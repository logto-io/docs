<br />
<br />
[Logto](https://logto.io/) is an Auth0 alternative designed for modern apps and SaaS products. It
offers both [Cloud](https://cloud.logto.io/) and [Open-source](https://github.com/logto-io/logto)
services to help you quickly launch your identity and management (IAM) system. Enjoy authentication,
authorization, and multi-tenant management [all in one](https://docs.logto.io/introduction).{' '}

We recommend starting with a free development tenant on [Logto Cloud](https://cloud.logto.io/). This allows you to explore all the features easily.

In this article, we will go through the steps to quickly build the {props.connector} sign-in
