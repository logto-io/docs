This document (the "Agreement" or "Terms of Service") constitutes the Terms of Service for Logto Cloud. Logto Cloud is an authentication and authorization managed service provided by Silverhand Inc., a Delaware corporation located at 2810 North Church Street, Wilmington, Delaware, 19802, United States. The Agreement is between Silverhand Inc. and the customer as set forth in the applicable order form or online subscription process ("Customer", collectively referred to as "the Parties").

For the purpose of this Agreement, "Customer" refers to any entity or individual, including any Tenant, that subscribes to or uses Logto Cloud. Each Tenant, being an independently managed division, department, or organizational unit within a subscribing entity, is considered a separate Customer under this Agreement and is subject to its own Terms of Service conditions.

## 1. Definitions

1. "Services" (or "Logto Cloud") refers to the authentication and authorization managed service provided by Silverhand Inc. through its website and associated APIs. Services exclude any third-party services or software that may be used in conjunction with Logto Cloud, even if such services are connected or integrated with Logto Cloud. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Silverhand Inc. will provide the Services to Customer during the term of this Agreement.
2. "Tenant" refers to a single instance of Logto Cloud that is provisioned for the Customer. Each Tenant is digitally isolated from other Tenants and has its own configuration, data, and users.

## 2. Conflict Resolution

1. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any order form, the terms of the order form shall prevail.
2. In the event of any conflict between Tenants under the same Customer account, Silverhand Inc. will initiate a conflict resolution process aimed at addressing and resolving the issues in a fair and equitable manner. This process may involve mediation, review of account activity, and communication with all involved parties. Silverhand Inc. reserves the right to make final decisions on conflict resolution based on the evidence and in accordance with our policies and applicable laws.

## 3. Fees and Payment

1. Fees: Customer agrees to pay the fees associated with their chosen subscription plan for Logto Cloud. The fees are based on the plan Customer selects and are subject to change at the discretion of Silverhand Inc. If an order form specifies a different fee, the fees specified in the order form will apply.
2. Payment: Customer agrees to provide Silverhand Inc. with valid and updated payment information. Customer authorizes Silverhand Inc. to charge their payment method for the fees associated with the subscription plan. Customer agrees to pay all fees within thirty (30) days from the invoice date. If any fees are not paid when due, Silverhand Inc. may suspend or terminate the Services.
3. Taxes: All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Customer is responsible for paying all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes based on Silverhand Inc.'s net income.

## 4. Term and Termination

1. Term: This Agreement commences on the date Customer creates a Tenant account and continues until terminated in accordance with this Agreement.
2. Subscription Cancellation: Customer may cancel their paid subscription at any time by following the cancellation process outlined on the Logto Cloud website. Upon cancellation, Customer will not be charged for any subsequent billing cycles, and their access to the paid features of the Tenant will be terminated immediately. Subscription cancellation alone does not result in the termination of this Agreement. Termination occurs only upon deletion of the Tenant or if either party chooses to terminate the Agreement.
3. Termination for Cause: Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of the breach. Silverhand Inc. may also terminate this Agreement immediately if Customer fails to pay the fees when due. Upon termination, Customer still owes any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term. If this Agreement is terminated by Customer for cause, Silverhand Inc. will refund any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term.
4. Effect of Termination: Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer's right to access and use Logto Cloud will immediately cease. Silverhand Inc. may delete Customer's data 30 days following termination. Customer may request a copy of their data before termination when all fees are paid in full. Silverhand Inc. will provide Customer with a reasonable opportunity to retrieve their data before deletion, but Silverhand Inc. is not responsible for any data loss that occurs after termination.
5. Termination Impact: The termination of a Tenant for reasons including, but not limited to, breach of the Terms of Service, non-payment, or illegal activities, will be conducted on an individual basis. Termination of one Tenant does not automatically lead to the termination of other Tenants under the same Customer account. However, Silverhand Inc. reserves the right to review associated Tenants for compliance with the Terms of Service.

## 5. License and Use of Services

1. License: Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Silverhand Inc. grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and use Logto Cloud for the duration of the subscription term. This license is solely for Customer's business purposes and is subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement.
2. Authorized Users: Customer may permit its employees, contractors, or agents to access and use Logto Cloud by inviting them to Customer's Tenant. The number of authorized users is limited to the number specified in the subscription plan, and Customer may pay additional fees to add more authorized users. Each authorized user may be used only by one individual and may not be shared with others. Customer is responsible for the actions of its authorized users and ensuring their compliance with this Agreement. Customer agrees to promptly remove any authorized user who violates this Agreement and notify Silverhand Inc. of such violation.
3. Acceptable Use: Customer agrees to use Logto Cloud in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Customer is responsible for the content and data uploaded to Logto Cloud and must have the necessary rights and permissions to use and share such content.
