## 8. Data Protection and Privacy

At Logto Cloud, we take the security and privacy of your personal information seriously. We have implemented various security measures to protect your data, as outlined in our [Privacy Policy](../privacy-policy.mdx). Some of the key security practices we follow include:

1. **Secure Communication**: All communication between you and our Logto services is enforced by [TLS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) (Transport Layer Security) to ensure that all data transmitted between your device and our service is encrypted and secure.
2. **Private Database Network**: The Logto database resides in a private network within the [Azure West Europe region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#choose-your-region) and has no direct access to the public internet. This setup ensures that your data is stored in a secure and protected environment.
3. **Data Isolation**: Each tenant has a dedicated database role, and we enforce [Row-Level Security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/ddl-rowsecurity.html) to ensure that your data is isolated within the database. This means that only authorized users have access to the data, and each tenant's data is completely separated from that of other tenants.
4. **Password Encryption**: We prioritize the security of your passwords. Logto does not store passwords in plain text. Instead, all passwords are encrypted using the [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) algorithm, a secure password hashing algorithm. This ensures that even in the event of a data breach, your password remains protected and uncompromised.
5. **Database Encryption**: For an added layer of security, all data stored in the Logto database is encrypted at rest, ensuring that your sensitive information remains safe and protected. You can find more details about our database encryption in the section on [Information protection and encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-security#information-protection-and-encryption).

We regularly review and update our security practices to ensure that your personal information is safeguarded at all times. If you have any questions or concerns about the security of your personal information, please feel free to contact our security team at [security@logto.io](mailto:security@logto.io).

## 9. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Silverhand Inc. from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising out of or related to your use of Logto Cloud or any violation of these Terms of Use.

## 10. Changes to the Service

Silverhand Inc. may make updates, enhancements, or changes to the service from time to time. These changes are aimed at enhancing the functionality, security, and overall performance of Logto Cloud.

Any changes we make will be carefully considered and aligned with our commitment to delivering a reliable and efficient service. While we may introduce new features or adjust existing ones, our core mission of providing a secure and user-friendly authentication and authorization managed service remains unwavering.

Significant updates or changes that may materially impact your usage of Logto Cloud will be communicated to you in advance, whenever possible. We value your feedback and will take it into account as we continue to evolve the service to better meet your needs.
