# Organization data structure

At the organization level, there are several attributes whose values can be created, updated, read, and deleted (CRUD).

## Organization ID \{#organization-id}

The _organization id_ is a unique identifier for each organization. It’s useful for implementing organization-level sign-in experiences and retrieving organization tokens.

## Name \{#name}

The _name_ supports organization-level sign-in and can be integrated into organization-level product interfaces as needed.

## Description \{#description}

The _description_ field allows you to add text to help identify and label the organization.

## Organization logos \{#organization-logos}

To dynamically show your client’s organization logo in the sign-in experience, you can upload the organization logos to the organization settings page.

See [organization-specific logos](/customization/match-your-brand/#organization-specific-branding) for more details.

## Custom data \{#custom-data}

_Custom data_ is a JSON object used to store extra information about the organization. It gives developers flexibility to store additional organization details for development purposes.

## Is MFA required \{#is-mfa-required}

_isMfaRequired_ indicates whether Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandatory for the organization. If set to `true`, all members must bypass MFA during sign-in to access the organization. This security policy setting is configured at the organization level.

See [Manage organization](/organizations/organization-management#require-mfa-for-organization-members) for more details.

## Created at \{#created-at}

_createdAt_ is the timestamp with the timezone when the organization was created.

## Tenant ID \{#tenant-id}

_tenantId_ identifies the tenant that the organization belongs to.
