# Protect API resource with organization template

In addition to [Protect your API](/authorization/api-resources/protect-your-api) which secures resources by ensuring a valid JWT is present, organization roles can also be applied to filter the scopes. In this article, We'll focus on how organization role affects scope delegation and validation in your authentication flow.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Logto
    participant API

    Note over Client,API: Token Request
    Client->>Logto: POST /oidc/token
    Note right of Client: with resource, organization_id,<br/>and requested scopes

    Note over Logto: Verify user belongs to<br/>the specified organization
    Logto-->>Client: Returns JWT access token
    Note left of Logto: Token contains:<br/>- Standard JWT claims<br/>- organization_id<br/>- Scopes filtered by organization role

    Note over Client,API: API Request
    Client->>API: Request with Bearer token

    Note over API: Validate JWT token:<br/>1. Standard JWT validation<br/>2. Verify organization_id<br/>3. Verify scopes

    alt Token Invalid
        API-->>Client: 401 Unauthorized
    else Token Valid
        alt Valid organization_id and scope
            API-->>Client: Protected Resource
        else Otherwise
            API-->>Client: 403 Forbidden
        end
    end
```

## The additional `organization_id` parameter \{#the-additional-organization_id-parameter}

In addition to normal access token grant request, in the diagram we add an additional `organization_id` parameter, this tells Logto to narrow down the scopes to specific organization's roles.

## Client setup \{#client-setup}

If you are using Logto's SDK, you can add `organization_id` as the second parameter of the `getAccessToken` method.

```tsx
const accessToken = await logto.getAccessToken('https://my-resource.com/api', 'org_1');

// Or getting claims directly
const accessTokenClaims = await logto.getAccessTokenClaims('https://my-resource.com/api', 'org_1');
console.log(accessTokenClaims.organization_id); // 'org_1'
console.log(accessTokenClaims.aud); // 'https://my-resource.com/api'
```

Then only the scopes inherited from this organization's roles will be included in the access token, as well as an additional claim `organization_id` .

## API server validation \{#api-server-validation}

In addition to the normal JWT access token validation, youâ€™ll need to add additional level to check if `organization_id` is present and valid.
