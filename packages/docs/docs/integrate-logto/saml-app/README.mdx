# SAML App

Logto supports integration as an [Identity Provider (IdP)](https://auth.wiki/identity-provider) with SAML protocol-based applications [Service Provider, SP](https://auth.wiki/service-provider). Through SAML app integration, you can provide enterprise users with a secure, standardized Single Sign-On (SSO) experience.

## Introduction \{#introduction}

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties. In a SAML integration:

- **Logto as IdP**: Acts as the central authentication authority, managing user identities and issuing SAML assertions
- **Your Application as SP**: Relies on Logto to authenticate users and consumes SAML assertions for access control

### How SAML authentication works \{#how-saml-authentication-works}

SAML authentication in Logto primarily follows the SP-initiated flow, where the authentication process starts from your application (Service Provider). Here's a brief overview:

1. User attempts to access your application
2. Your application generates a SAML request and redirects the user to Logto
3. User authenticates with Logto
4. Logto generates a SAML response containing user information
5. Your application validates the response and grants access

For a more detailed explanation of SAML authentication flows and comparison with other protocols, check out our [authentication flow guide](/integrate-logto/integrate-logto-into-your-application/understand-authentication-flow.mdx#saml-authentication-flow).

### Benefits of SAML integration \{#benefits-of-saml-integration}

- **Enhanced Security**: Encrypted communication and digital signatures ensure secure data exchange
- **Simplified User Experience**: Users only need to sign in once to access multiple applications
- **Reduced Administrative Overhead**: Centralized user management and access control
- **Enterprise Readiness**: Widely adopted by organizations for secure identity federation

## Key Features \{#key-features}

- **Standardized Integration**: Full support for SAML 2.0 protocol, ensuring compatibility with various service providers
- **Flexible Attribute Mapping**: Support for custom user attribute mapping to meet different application data requirements
- **Secure and Reliable**: Support for signing and encryption to protect the authentication process
- **Automatic Configuration**: Support for quick SAML integration setup via metadata URL or file

## Use Cases \{#use-cases}

SAML app integration is suitable for the following scenarios:

- Enterprise application systems requiring Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Integration with third-party services supporting SAML protocol
- Requirements for high security and standardized authentication processes

## Create an SAML application in Logto \{#create-an-saml-application-in-logto}

1. Go to <CloudLink to="/applications">Console > Applications</CloudLink>
2. Select "My apps" as the application type and choose the following integration protocol "SAML"
3. Enter a name and description for your application and click on the “Create” button. A new SAML application will be created.

## Configuration Guide \{#configuration-guide}

To start using SAML app integration, you need to complete the following steps:

1. [Configure SAML App](/integrate-logto/saml-app/setup.mdx): Set up basic SAML integration parameters
2. [Configure Attribute Mapping](/integrate-logto/saml-app/attribute-mapping.mdx): Define how to map Logto user attributes to SAML assertions

After completing the configuration, your application can securely authenticate and exchange data with Logto through the SAML protocol.
