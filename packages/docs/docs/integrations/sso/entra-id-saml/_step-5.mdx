Provide the `email domains` of your organization at Logto's connector `SSO experience` tab. This will enable the SSO connector as an authentication method for those users.

Users with email addresses in the specified domains will be redirected to use the SAML SSO connector as their only authentication method.

Please check Azure AD's official [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-setup-sso) for more details about the Azure AD SSO integration.
