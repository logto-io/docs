To make the SAML SSO integration work, you will need to provide the IdP metadata to Logto. The IdP metadata is an [XML](https://blog.logto.io/what-is-xml) document that contains all the information required for Logto to establish the trust with the IdP.

Navigate to the `Connection` tab. Logto provides three different ways to configure the IdP metadata:

1. **Metadata URL**: Provide the URL of the IdP metadata XML document. Logto will fetch the metadata from the URL and configure the SAML SSO integration automatically.
2. **Upload Metadata**: Upload the IdP metadata XML document. Logto will parse the XML document and configure the SAML SSO integration automatically.
3. **Manual Configuration**: Manually configure the IdP metadata.

- IdP entity ID: The Entity ID of the IdP.
- Single sign-on URL: The URL of the IdP Single Sign-On Service.
- Signing certificate: The x509 certificate is used to verify the signature of the SAML response from the IdP.

With either of the above configurations, Logto will parse the IdP metadata and configure the SAML SSO integration accordingly.
