The user attributes returned from IdP may vary depending on the IdP configuration. Logto provides a flexible way to map the user attributes returned from IdP to the user attributes in Logto. You can configure the user attributes mapping in the SAML SSO integration experience tab.

- id: The unique identifier of the user. Logto will read the `nameId` claim from the SAML response as the user SSO identity id.
- email: The email address of the user.
- name: The name of the user.
