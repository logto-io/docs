After successfully creating an OIDC application on the IdP side, you will need to provide the IdP configurations back to Logto. Navigate to the `Connection` tab, and fill in the following configurations:

- **Client ID**: A unique identifier assigned to your OIDC application by the IdP. This identifier is used by Logto to identify and authenticate the application during the OIDC flow.
- **Client Secret**: A confidential secret shared between Logto and the IdP. This secret is used to authenticate the OIDC application and secure the communication between Logto and the IdP.
- **Issuer**: The issuer URL, a unique identifier for the IdP, specifying the location where the OIDC identity provider can be found. It is a crucial part of the OIDC configuration as it helps Logto discover the necessary endpoints.
  To make the configuration process easier. Logto will automatically fetch the required OIDC endpoints and configurations. This is done by utilizing the issuer you provided and making a call to the IdP's OIDC discover endpoints. It is imperative to ensure that the issuer endpoint is valid and accurately configured to enable Logto to retrieve the required information correctly.
  After a successful fetch request, you should be able to see the parsed IdP configurations under the issuers section.
- **Scope**: A space-separated list of strings defining the desired permissions or access levels requested by Logto during the OIDC authentication process. The scope parameter allows you to specify what information and access Logto is requesting from the IdP.
  The scope parameter is optional. Regardless of the custom scope settings, Logto will always send the `openid`, `profile` and `email` scopes to the IdP.
  This is to ensure that Logto can retrieve the user's identity information and email address properly from the IdP. You may add additional scopes to the scope parameter to request for more information from the IdP.
