Before we dive into the details, here's a quick overview of the end-user experience. The sign-in process can be simplified as follows:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A(Your app) -->|1. Invoke sign-in| B(Logto)
    B -->|2. Finish sign-in| A
```

1. Your app invokes the sign-in method.
2. The user is redirected to the Logto sign-in page. For native apps, the system browser is opened.
3. The user signs in and is redirected back to your app (configured as the redirect URI).
