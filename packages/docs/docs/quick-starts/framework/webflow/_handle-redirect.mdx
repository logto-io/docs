We're almost there! In the last step, we use `https://your-awesome-site.webflow.io/callback` as the Redirect URI, and now we need to handle it properly.

First let's create a "Callback" page in Webflow, and simply put some static text "Redirecting..." on it. Then add the following page-level custom code to "Callback" page.

```html
<script type="module">
  (async () => {
    // Handle sign-in callback logic by calling the SDK method
    await logtoClient.handleSignInCallback(window.location.href);

    // Redirect back to the home page when the handling is done
    window.location.assign('https://your-awesome-site.webflow.io');
  })();
</script>
```
