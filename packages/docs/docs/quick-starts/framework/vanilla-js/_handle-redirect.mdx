There are still things to do after the user is redirected back to your application from Logto. Let's handle it properly.

```js title="pages/Callback.js"
const callbackHandler = async (logtoClient) => {
  await logtoClient.handleSignInCallback(window.location.href);

  if (!logtoClient.isAuthenticated) {
    // Handle failed sign-in
    alert('Failed to sign in');
    return;
  }

  // Handle successful sign-in
  window.location.assign('/');
};
```
