Initialize the client by creating a `LogtoClient` instance with a `LogtoConfig` object.

```swift title="ContentView.swift"
import Logto
import LogtoClient

let config = try? LogtoConfig(
  endpoint: "<your-logto-endpoint>", // E.g. http://localhost:3001
  appId: "<your-app-id>"
)
let client = LogtoClient(useConfig: config)
```

:::info

By default, we store credentials like ID Token and Refresh Token in the Keychain. Thus the user doesn't need to sign in again when he returns.

To turn off this behavior, set `usingPersistStorage` to `false`:

```swift
let config = try? LogtoConfig(
  // ...
  usingPersistStorage: false
)
```
