# Tenant member management

## Invite collaborators \{#invite-collaborators}

Go to <CloudLink to="/tenant-settings/members">Console > Tenant Settings > Members</CloudLink>. You'll see your current members and can invite more. Enter email addresses and assign roles (you can do this in bulk) and then send.

Logto lets you invite team members to your tenant with two different roles in Logto Cloud:

- **Admin:** Full access and management of all tenant resources.
- **Collaborator:** Can manage identity-related resources, but with limitations:
  - No access to billing information
  - Cannot invite or manage other members
  - Cannot change the tenant name
  - Cannot delete the tenant

### Members limit \{#members-limit}

| Tenant type            | Member limit                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Dev tenant             | Up to 3 members (contact us for more)                |
| Free production tenant | 1 member (admin only)                                |
| Pro production tenant  | Starts with 3 members, then $8 per additional member |

### Manage invitation \{#manage-invitation}

The invitation tab shows past invitations with their status

| Status   | Explanation                            | Available action |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Pending  | Invitation sent, but not yet accepted. | Resend           |
| Accepted | User is now a tenant member.           | Delete           |
| Expired  | Invitation exceeded the 7-day limit.   | Delete           |
| Revoked  | Admin cancelled the invitation.        | Delete           |

You can't invite people who already have pending invitations or are members.

### Manage tenant members (Admin only) \{#manage-tenant-members-admin-only}

As an admin, you have several ways to manage your team:

- **Invite or remove members:** Add new team members or remove access as needed.
- **Change member roles:** Assign 'admin' or 'collaborator' roles depending on the required access level.
- **Transfer tenant ownership:** If needed, you can transfer the ownership of the tenant to another member. You can first give the admin role to another member and then choose to stay as a regular member or leave the tenant entirely.
- **Add multiple admins:** Share administrative responsibilities with other team members for collaborative management.
