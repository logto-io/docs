# User data structure

Users are the core entities in the identity service. In Logto, they include basic authentication data based on the [OpenID Connect](https://auth.wiki/openid-connect) protocol, along with custom data.

## User profile \{#user-profile}

Each user has a profile containing [all user information](#property-reference).

It consists of the following types of data:

- [Basic data](/user-management/user-data#basic-data): is the basic info from the user profile. It stores all other _user_'s properties except for social `identities` and `custom_data`, such as user id, username, email, phone number, and when the user last signed in.
- [Social identities](/user-management/user-data#social-identities): stores the user info retrieved from social sign-in (i.e., sign-in with a social connector), such as Facebook, GitHub, and WeChat.
- [Custom data](/user-management/user-data#custom-data): stores additional user info not listed in the pre-defined user properties, such as user-preferred color and language.

Here is a sample of a user's data which is retrieved from a sign-in to Facebook:

```json
{
  "id": "iHXPuSb9eMzt",
  "username": null,
  "primaryEmail": null,
  "primaryPhone": null,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png",
  "customData": {
    "preferences": {
      "language": "en",
      "color": "#f236c9"
    }
  },
  "identities": {
    "facebook": {
      "userId": "106077000000000",
      "details": {
        "id": "106077000000000",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "johndoe@logto.io",
        "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
      }
    }
  },
  "lastSignInAt": 1655799453171,
  "applicationId": "admin_console"
}
```

You can query the user profile using <CloudLink to="/users">Logto Console</CloudLink> or Logto Management API, such as [`GET /api/users/:userId`](https://openapi.logto.io/operation/operation-getuser).

## Basic data \{#basic-data}

Let's walk through all properties in of user's _basic data_.

### id \{#id}

_id_ is a unique auto-generated key to identify the user in Logto.

### username \{#username}

_username_ is used for sign-in with _username_ and password.

Its value is from the username that the user first registered with. It may be `null`. Its non-null value should be no longer than 128 characters, only contain letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`), and NOT start with a number. It's case-sensitive.

### primary_email \{#primary_email}

_primary_email_ is the user's email address, used for sign-in with the email and password / verification code.

Its value is usually from the email address that the user first registered with. It may be `null`. Its max length is 128.

### primary_phone \{#primary_phone}

_primary_phone_ is the user's phone number, used for sign-in with the phone number and password / verification code from SMS.

Its value is usually from the phone number that the user first registered with. It may be `null`. Its non-null value should contain numbers prefixed with the [country calling code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes) (excluding the plus sign `+`).

### name \{#name}

_name_ is the user's full name. Its max length is 128.

### avatar \{#avatar}

_avatar_ is the URL pointing to the user's avatar image. Its max length is 2048.

If the user registers with a social connector like Google and Facebook, its value may be retrieved from the social user info.

:::note

This property is mapped to the `picture` claim in the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) standard.

:::

### profile \{#profile}

_profile_ stores additional OpenID Connect [standard claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims) that are not included in user's properties.

Its type definition can be found at [this file](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/blob/HEAD/packages/schemas/src/foundations/jsonb-types/users.ts#L6). Here's a copy of the type definition:

```tsx
type UserProfile = Partial<{
  familyName: string;
  givenName: string;
  middleName: string;
  nickname: string;
  preferredUsername: string;
  profile: string;
  website: string;
  gender: string;
  birthdate: string;
  zoneinfo: string;
  locale: string;
  address: Partial<{
    formatted: string;
    streetAddress: string;
    locality: string;
    region: string;
    postalCode: string;
    country: string;
  }>;
}>;
```

:::note

`Partial` means that all properties are optional.

:::

A difference compared to the other standard claims is that the properties in `profile` will only be included in the [ID token](https://auth.wiki/id-token) or userinfo endpoint response when their values are not empty, while other standard claims will return `null` if the values are empty.

### application_id \{#application_id}

The value of _application_id_ is from the application the user first signed in to. It may be `null`.

### last_sign_in_at \{#last_sign_in_at}

_last_sign_in_at_ is the timestamp with the timezone when the user signed in last time.

### created_at \{#created_at}

_created_at_ is the timestamp with the timezone when the user registered the account.

### updated_at \{#updated_at}

_updated_at_ is the timestamp with the timezone when the user's profile information was last updated.

### has_password \{#has_password}

_has_password_ is a boolean value that indicates whether the user has a password. You can view and manage this status, including setting a new or resetting the password on the detail page of <CloudLink to="/users">Console > User management</CloudLink>.

### password_encrypted \{#password_encrypted}

_password_encrypted_ is used to store the user's encrypted password.

Its value is from the password that the user first registered with. It may be `null`. If its value is non-null, its original content before encryption should be at least six characters.

### password_encryption_method \{#password_encryption_method}

_password_encryption_method_ is used to encrypt the user's password. Its value is initialized when the user registers with the username and password. It may be `null`.

Logto uses [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)'s implementation [node-argon2](https://github.com/ranisalt/node-argon2) as the encryption method by default; see the reference for details if you're interested.

Sample a _password_encrypted_ and _password_encryption_method_ from a user whose password is `123456`:

```json
{
  "password_encryption_method": "Argon2i",
  "password_encrypted": "$argon2i$v=19$m=4096,t=10,p=1$aZzrqpSX45DOo+9uEW6XVw$O4MdirF0mtuWWWz68eyNAt2u1FzzV3m3g00oIxmEr0U"
}
```

### is_suspended \{#is_suspended}

_is_suspended_ is a boolean value that indicates whether a user is suspended or not. The value can be managed by calling the [Logto Management API](https://openapi.logto.io/operation/operation-updateuserissuspended) or using Logto Console.

Once a user is suspended the pre-granted refresh tokens will be revoked immediately and the user won't be able to get authenticated by Logto anymore.

### mfa_verification_factors \{#mfa_verification_factors}

_mfa_verification_factors_ is an array that lists the [multi-factor authentication](/end-user-flows/mfa) (MFA) methods associated with the user’s account. The possible values include: _Totp_ (Authenticator app OTP), _WebAuthn_ (Passkey), and _BackupCode_.

```tsx
mfaVerificationFactors: ("Totp" | "WebAuthn" | "BackupCode")[];
```

## Social identities \{#social-identities}

_identities_ contains the user info retrieved from [social sign-in](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/social-sign-in) (i.e., sign-in with a [social connector](/connectors/social-connectors)). Each user's _identities_ is stored in an individual JSON object.

The user info varies by social identity provider (i.e., social network platform), and it typically includes the following:

- _target_ of the identity provider, such as "facebook" or "google"
- User's unique identifier for this provider
- User's name
- User's verified email
- User's avatar

The user's account may be linked to multiple social identity providers via social sign-in; the corresponding user info retrieved from these providers will be stored in the _identities_ object.

Sample _identities_ from a user who signed in with both Google and Facebook:

```json
{
  "facebook": {
    "userId": "5110888888888888",
    "details": {
      "id": "5110888888888888",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "johndoe@logto.io",
      "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
    }
  },
  "google": {
    "userId": "111000000000000000000",
    "details": {
      "id": "111000000000000000000",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "johndoe@gmail.com",
      "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
    }
  }
}
```

## SSO identities \{#sso-identities}

_sso_identities_ contains the user info retrieved from [Enterprise SSO](/end-user-flows/enterprise-sso) (i.e., Single Sign-On login with an enterprise connector](/connectors/enterprise-connectors)). Each user's _ssoIdentities_ is stored in an individual JSON object.

The data synced from the SSO identity provider depends the scopes configured in the enterprise connector to request. Here's a copy of the TypeScript type definition:

```ts
type SSOIdentity = {
  issuer: string;
  identityId: string;
  detail: JsonObject; // See https://github.com/withtyped/withtyped/blob/master/packages/server/src/types.ts#L12
};
```

## Custom data \{#custom-data}

_custom_data_ stores additional user info not listed in the pre-defined user properties.

You can use _custom_data_ to do the following things:

- Record whether specific actions have been done by the user, such as having seen the welcome page.
- Store application-specific data in the user profile, such as the user's preferred language and appearance per application.
- Maintain other arbitrary data related to the user.

Sample _custom_data_ from an admin user in Logto:

```json
{
  "adminConsolePreferences": {
    "language": "en",
    "appearanceMode": "system",
    "experienceNoticeConfirmed": true
  },
  "customDataFoo": {
    "foo": "foo"
  },
  "customDataBar": {
    "bar": "bar"
  }
}
```

Each user's _custom_data_ is stored in an individual JSON object.

Note: DO NOT put sensitive data in _custom_data_.

You may fetch a user profile containing _custom_data_ using [Management API](https://openapi.logto.io/operation/operation-listusercustomdata) and send it to the frontend apps or external backend services. Therefore, putting the sensitive information in _custom_data_ may cause data leaks.

If you still want to put the sensitive information in _custom_data_, we recommend encrypting it first. Only encrypt/decrypt it in a trusted party like your backend services, and avoid doing it in the frontend apps. These will minimize the loss if your users' _custom_data_ is leaked by mistake.

You can update the user's _custom_data_ using [Logto Console](/user-management/manage-users/#view-and-update-the-user-profile) or [Logto Management API](/user-management/manage-users/#manage-via-logto-management-api), such as [`PATCH /api/users/:userId`](https://openapi.logto.io/operation/operation-getuser).

Update carefully

Updating a user's _custom_data_ will completely overwrite its original content in the storage.

For example, if your input of calling update _custom_data_ API looks like this (suppose that the original _custom_data_ is previous shown sample data):

```json
{
  "customDataBaz": {
    "baz": "baz"
  }
}
```

then new _custom_data_ value after updating should be:

```json
{
  "customDataBaz": {
    "baz": "baz"
  }
}
```

That is, the updated field value has nothing to do with the previous value.

## Property reference \{#property-reference}

The following DB user table columns (except _password_encrypted_ and _password_encryption_method_) are visible on the user profile, which means you can query them using [Management API](https://openapi.logto.io/operation/operation-getuser).
