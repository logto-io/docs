# Consent screen branding

It is important to ensure the third-party's branding information and terms link is properly displayed to the users when they are redirected to the third-party application's consent screen.

Logto allows you to customize the branding information of your third-party applications, including the application name, logo, and terms link.

## Customize the branding information

1. Go to the <CloudLink to="/applications/third-party-applications">Console > Application > Third-party apps</CloudLink> and open the details page for a specific OIDC third-party application.

2. Navigate to the **Branding** tab.

3. Configure the display information for the consent screen:

- **Display name**: The name of the third-party application that will be displayed on the consent screen. It will represent the third-party application's name who is requesting access to your users' information. **Application name** will be used if this field is left empty.
- **App logo (Light)**: The logo of the third-party application that will be displayed on the consent screen. It will represent the third-party application's brand who is requesting access to your users' information. Both third-party application's logo and your universal sign-in-experience logo will be displayed on the consent screen if both are provided.
- **App logo (Dark)**: Only available when dark-mode sign-in experience is enabled. Manage the dark-mode settings at the <CloudLink to="/sign-in-experience/branding">Console > Sign-in experience > Branding</CloudLink> page.
- **Terms of use URL**: The terms link of the third-party application that will be displayed on the consent screen.
- **Privacy policy URL**: The privacy link of the third-party application that will be displayed on the consent screen.
