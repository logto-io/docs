# Connectors

Connectors are the bridge between Logto and external services. They enable passwordless-verification methods like email verification, SMS verification, social login, and enterprise SSO.

Traditional account registration with usernames and passwords can be a tedious and frustrating process. Users often struggle to remember complex passwords and may be hesitant to create new accounts due to the inconvenience. If users can provide their email or phone number and verify it via verification codes; or log in using accounts like Google/Facebook, or corporate accounts like Microsoft, this can greatly simplify the login process and reduce user churn. Connector was created to solve this problem.

## Connector types

Logto offers four types of connectors:
