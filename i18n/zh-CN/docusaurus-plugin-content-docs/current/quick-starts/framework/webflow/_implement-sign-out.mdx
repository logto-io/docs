Calling `.signOut()` will clear all the Logto data in memory and localStorage if they exist.

After signing out, it'll be great to redirect your user back to your website. Let's add `https://your-awesome-site.webflow.io` as one of the Post Sign-out URIs in Admin Console (shows under Redirect URIs), and use the URL as the parameter when calling `.signOut()`.

#### Implement a sign-out button

Return to the Webflow designer, and add a “Sign out” button on your home page. Similarly, assign an ID “sign-out” to the button, and add the following code to the page-level custom code.

```js
const signOutButton = document.getElementById('sign-out');
const onClickSignOut = () => logtoClient.signOut('https://your-awesome-site.webflow.io');
signOutButton.addEventListener('click', onClickSignOut);
```
