Logto uses OIDC [scopes and claims conventions](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims) to define the scopes and claims for retrieving user information from the ID token and OIDC <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo">userinfo endpoint</a>. Both of the "scope" and the "claim" are terms from the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) specifications.

In short, when you request a scope, you will get the corresponding claims in the user information. For example, if you request the `email` scope, you will get the `email` and `email_verified` data of the user.

<ScopeClaimList />

Add extra scopes and claims at the `application.properties` file to request for more user information. For example, to request the `urn:logto:scope:organizations` scope, add the following line to the `application.properties` file:

```properties title="application.properties"
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.logto.scope=openid,profile,offline_access,urn:logto:scope:organizations
```

User organization claims will be included in the authorization token.
