# Get started with OSS

## GitPod

To start an online GitPod workspace for Logto, <a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/logto-io/demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a>. Wait a few moment, you&apos;ll see the message like:

<p>
  <img src={gitpodRunning} alt="Gitpod is running" width="720px" style={{ borderRadius: '4px' }} />
</p>

Logto uses port `3001` for its core service and port `3002` for the interactive Admin Console by default.

To continue your Logto journey, press Ctrl (or Cmd) and click the link that starts with `https://3002-...`. Enjoy!

## Local

The minimum recommended hardware requirements for hosting Logto are:

- **vCPU**: 2
- **Memory**: 8 GiB
- **Disk**: 256 GiB

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">

Docker Compose CLI usually comes with [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

:::caution
Do not use our docker compose command for production! Since we currently have a built-in Postgres database bundled together with the Logto app in `docker-compose.yml`,
every time you re-execute the command a new database instance will be created, and any data persisted previously will be lost.
:::

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logto-io/logto/HEAD/docker-compose.yml | docker compose -p logto -f - up
```

After a successful composition, you will see the message like:

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

<h3>Step 1</h3>

Prepare a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)@^14.0 instance, and using [Logto CLI](/logto-oss/using-cli) to seed a database for Logto:

<Tabs groupId="cmd">

  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```bash
logto db seed
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx">

```bash
npx @logto/cli db seed
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

Pull the image:

```bash
# ghcr
docker pull ghcr.io/logto-io/logto:latest
# DockerHub
docker pull svhd/logto:latest
```

<h3>Step 3</h3>

Map the container ports to Logto core and admin app, e.g., `3001:3001` and `3002:3002`; and set the following environment variables to the container:

```yml
TRUST_PROXY_HEADER: 1 # Set to 1 if you have an HTTPS proxy (e.g. Nginx) in front of Logto
ENDPOINT: https://<your-logto-domain> # (Optional) Replace with your Logto endpoint URL if you are using a custom domain
ADMIN_ENDPOINT: https://<your-logto-admin-domain> # (Optional) Replace with your Logto admin URL if you are using a custom domain
DB_URL: postgres://username:password@your_postgres_url:port/db_name # Replace with your Postgres DSN
```

Run the container with all the environment variables above:

```bash
docker run \
  --name logto \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -p 3002:3002 \
  -e TRUST_PROXY_HEADER=1 \
  -e ENDPOINT=https://<your-logto-domain> \
  -e ADMIN_ENDPOINT=https://<your-logto-admin-domain> \
  -e DB_URL=postgres://username:password@your_postgres_url:port/db_name \
  ghcr.io/logto-io/logto:latest
```

:::tip

- If you are using Docker Hub, use `svhd/logto:latest` instead of `ghcr.io/logto-io/logto:latest`.
- Use `host.docker.internal` or `172.17.0.1` in `DB_URL` to refer to the host IP.

:::

Finally, you will see the message like:

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="npm" label="npm-init">

**Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `^18.12.0`
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/) `^14.0`

Higher versions usually work but are not guaranteed.

We recommend using a new empty database which is dedicated for Logto, while it&apos;s not a hard requirement.

**Download and start**

In your terminal:

```bash
npm init @logto@latest
```

Once you complete the init process and start Logto, you will see the message like:

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

```text
Core app is running at http://localhost:3001
Core app is running at https://your-domain-url
Admin app is running at http://localhost:3002
Admin app is running at https://your-admin-domain-url
```

Heading to `http://localhost:3002/` to continue your Logto journey. Enjoy!

<details>

<summary>Using an alternative URL for downloading</summary>

If you want to specify a URL for the Logto zip file, use the `--download-url` option. For example:

```
npm init @logto@latest -- --download-url=https://github.com/logto-io/logto/releases/download/v1.2.2/logto.tar.gz
```

Note the extra `--` is needed for NPM to pass the arguments.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Configuration (optional)</summary>

Logto uses environment variables for configuration, along with `.env` file support. See [Configuration](/concepts/core-service/configuration) for detailed usage and full variable list.

</details>

_Check out [Core service](/concepts/core-service) if you want more advanced controls or programmatic access to Logto._

## Create an account

Once you have successfully hosted Logto on your server, click on "Create account" on the welcome page. Keep in mind that the open-source version of Logto only allows for one account creation during the initial launch and does not support multiple accounts. The account creation process is limited to username and password combinations.
