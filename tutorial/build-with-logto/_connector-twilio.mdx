### Register Twilio account

Create a new account on [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com). (Jump to the next step if you already have one.)

### Set up senders' phone numbers

Go to the [Twilio console page](https://console.twilio.com/) and sign in with your Twilio account.

Purchase a phone number under "Phone Numbers" -> "Manage" -> "Buy a number".

> ℹ️ **Tip**
>
> Sometimes you may encounter the situation that SMS service is not supported in specific countries or areas. Pick a number from other regions to bypass.

Once we have a valid number claimed, navigate to the "Messaging" -> "Services". Create a new Message Service by clicking on the button.

Give a friendly service name and choose _Notify my users_ as our service purpose.
Following the next step, choose `Phone Number` as _Sender Type_, and add the phone number we just claimed to this service as a sender.

> ℹ️ **Note**
>
> Each phone number can only be linked with one messaging service.

### Get account credentials

We will need the API credentials to make the connector work. Let's begin with the [Twilio console page](https://console.twilio.com/).

Click on the "Account" menu in the top-right corner, then go to the "API keys & tokens" page to get your `Account SID` and `Auth token`.

Back to "Messaging" -> "Services" settings page starting from the sidebar, and find the `Sid` of your service.

### Compose the connector JSON

Fill out the _accountSID_, _authToken_ and _fromMessagingServiceSID_ fields with `Account SID`, `Auth token` and `Sid` of the corresponding messaging service.

You can add multiple SMS connector templates for different cases. Here is an example of adding a single template:

- Fill out the `content` field with arbitrary string-typed contents. Do not forget to leave `{{code}}` placeholder for random verification code.
- Fill out the `usageType` field with either `Register`, `SignIn`, `ForgotPassword`, `Generic` for different use cases. In order to enable full user flows, templates with usageType `Register`, `SignIn`, `ForgotPassword` and `Generic` are required.

#### Test Twilio SMS connector

You can enter a phone number and click on "Send" to see whether the settings can work before "Save and Done".

That's it. Don't forget to [Enable connector in sign-in experience](https://docs.logto.io/docs/tutorials/get-started/passwordless-sign-in-by-adding-connectors#enable-sms-or-email-passwordless-sign-in).
