### Set up Azure AD in the Azure Portal

- Visit the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and sign in with your Azure account. You need to have an active subscription to access Azure AD.
- Click the **Azure Active Directory** from the services they offer, and click the **App Registrations** from the left menu.
- Click **New Registration** at the top and enter a description, select your **access type** and add your **Redirect URI**, which redirect the user to the application after logging in. In our case, this will be `${your_logto_origin}/callback/${connector_id}`. e.g. `https://logto.dev/callback/${connector_id}`. You need to select Web as Platform. The `connector_id` can be found on the top bar of the Logto Admin Console connector details page.
- If you select **Single Tenant** for access type then you need to enter **TenantID**, else you need to enter `common` as Tenant ID.

### Configure your client secret

- In your newly created project, click the **Certificates & Secrets** to get a client secret, and click the **New client secret** from the top.
- Enter a description and an expiration.
- This will only show your client secret once. Save the **value** to a secure location.

### Compose the connector JSON

- Add your App Registration's **Client ID** into logto json.
- Add your **Client Secret** into logto json.
- Add your App Registration's **Tenant ID** into logto json.
- Add your Microsoft **Login Url** into logto json. This defaults to "https://login.microsoftonline.com/" for many applications, but you can set your custom domain if you have one. (Don't forget the trailing slash)

```jsonc
{
  "clientId": "<client-id>",
  "clientSecret": "<client-secret>",
  "tenantId": "<tenant-id>", // use "common" if you did't select **Single Tenant**
  "cloudInstance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
}
```

#### Config types

| Name          | Type   |
| ------------- | ------ |
| clientId      | string |
| clientSecret  | string |
| tenantId      | string |
| cloudInstance | string |
