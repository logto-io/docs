## Sign in with Hugging Face account

Go to the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/) and sign in with your Hugging Face account. You may register a new account if you don't have one.

## Create an OAuth app in the Hugging Face

Follow the [Creating an oauth app](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/oauth#creating-an-oauth-app) guide, and register a new application.

In the creation process, you will need to provide the following information:

- **Application Name**: The name of your application.
- **Homepage URL**: The URL of your application's homepage or landing page.
- **Logo URL**: The URL of your application's logo.
- **Scopes**: The scopes allowed for the OAuth app. For Hugging Face connector, usually use `profile` to get the user's profile information and `email` to get the user's email address. Ensure these scopes are allowed in your Hugging Face OAuth app if you want to use them.
- **Redirect URI**: The URL to redirect the user to after they have authenticated. You can find the redirect URI in the Logto Admin Console when you're creating a Hugging Face connector or in the created Hugging Face connector details page.

## Managing Hugging Face OAuth apps

Go to the [Connected Applications](https://huggingface.co/settings/connected-applications) page, you can add, edit or delete existing OAuth apps.
You can also find `Client ID` and generate `App secrets` in corresponding OAuth app settings pages.

## Configure your connector

Go back to Logto Admin Console And Fill out the `clientId` and `clientSecret` field with _Client ID_ and _App Secret_ you've got from OAuth app detail pages mentioned in the previous section.

`scope` is a space-delimited list of [Hugging Face supported scopes](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/oauth#currently-supported-scopes). If not provided, scope defaults to be `profile`. For Hugging Face connector, the scope you may want to use is `profile` and `email`. `profile` scope is required to get the user's profile information, and `email` scope is required to get the user's email address. Ensure you have allowed these scopes in your Hugging Face OAuth app (configured in [Create an OAuth app in the Hugging Face](#create-an-oauth-app-in-the-hugging-face) section).
