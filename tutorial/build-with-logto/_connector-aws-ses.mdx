### Configure a mail service in the AWS service console

Amazon SES is a cloud email service provider that can integrate into any application for bulk email sending.

Logto core calls the Amazon Simple Email Service APIs via this connector, with the help of which Logto end-users can register and sign in to their Logto account via email verification code.

   - Use the `AccessKey ID` and `AccessKey Secret` obtained in step 1 to fill in `accessKeyId` and `accessKeySecret` respectively.
   - `region`: Fill in the `region` field with the region of the identity you use to send mail.
   - `emailAddress`: The email address you use to send mail, in the format of `Logto<noreply@logto.io>` or `<noreply@logto.io>`

the following parameters are optional; parameters description can be found in the [AWS SES API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference-V2/API_SendEmail.html).

- `feedbackForwardingEmailAddress`
- `feedbackForwardingEmailAddressIdentityArn`
- `configurationSetName`
