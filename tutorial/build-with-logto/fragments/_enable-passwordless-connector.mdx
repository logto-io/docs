Once you create a {props.connector} connector successfully, you can enable phone number-based passwordless login and registration.

1. Navigate to [Console > Sign-in experience > Sign-up and sign-in](https://cloud.logto.io/to/sign-in-experience/sign-up-and-sign-in).
2. Set up sign-up methods (Optional):
   1. Select "{props.passwordlessSignUpIdentifier}" or "Email or phone number" as the sign-up identifier.
   2. "Verify at sign-up" is forced to be enabled. You can also enable "Create a password" on registration.
3. Set up sign-in methods:
   1. Select {props.passwordlessSignUpIdentifier} as one of sign-in identifiers. You can provide multiple available identifiers (email, phone number, and username).
   2. Select "Verification code" and / or "Password" as the authentication factor.
4. Click "Save changes" and test it in "Live preview".

In addition to registration and login via {props.connector} OTPs, you can also have password recovery and {props.connector}-based security verification enabled, as well as linking {props.passwordlessSignUpIdentifier} to profile. See [End-user flows](https://docs.logto.io/end-user-flows) for more details.
