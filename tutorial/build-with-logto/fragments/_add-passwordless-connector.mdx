{props.connectorType} connector is a method used to send one-time passwords (OTPs) for authentication. It enables {props.passwordlessSignUpIdentifier} verification to support passwordless authentication, including {props.connectorType}-based registration, sign-in, two-factor authentication (2FA), and account recovery.
You can easily connect {props.connector} as your {props.connectorType} provider. With the Logto {props.connectorType} connector, you can set this up in just a few minutes.
