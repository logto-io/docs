Once you create a social connector successfully, you can enable it as a "Continue with {props.connector}" button in Sign-in Experience.

1. Navigate to [Console > Sign-in experience > Sign-up and sign-in](https://cloud.logto.io/to/sign-in-experience/sign-up-and-sign-in).
2. (Optional) Choose "Not applicable" for sign-up identifier if you need social login only.
3. Add configured {props.connector} connector to the "Social sign-in" section.
