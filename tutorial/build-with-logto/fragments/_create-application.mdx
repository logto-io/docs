1. Open the [Logto Console](https://cloud.logto.io). In the "Get started" section, click the "View all" link to open the application frameworks list. Alternatively, you can navigate to [Logto Console > Applications](https://cloud.logto.io/to/applications), and click the "Create application" button.
