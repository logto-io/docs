# Configure email connector

Configuring an Email connector allows you to send a one-time password (OTP) to the user's email address ( Magic link will be supported in the future ). Email connector usage is similar to SMS connector, which can be utilized in various scenarios, including sign-up, sign-in, forgot password, and link-account processes, to validate the user's identity.

We provide Logto built-in email service for your online usage or onboarding. It is completely free to use and doesnâ€™t require any additional configuration. You just need to customize your basic brand information for email templates:

- [Logto email service](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/tree/master/packages/connectors/connector-logto-email)

Alternatively, you have the option to connect with other email service providers that Logto offers out-of-box usage. With these providers, you can customize your email templates freely:

- [AWS direct mail connector](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/tree/master/packages/connectors/connector-aws-ses)
- [SendGrid mail connector](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/tree/master/packages/connectors/connector-sendgrid-email)
- [SMTP connector](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/tree/master/packages/connectors/connector-smtp)
- [Aliyun direct mail connector](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/tree/master/packages/connectors/connector-aliyun-dm)

:::tip
We're still working on more connectors! But If you don't see the connector you want, just let us know your needs in Discord or file a Feature Request on GitHub.
For those using the Logto Open-Source Version, we offer the flexibility to [create your own connector](../../configure-connectors/create-your-connector/README.md) to extend.
