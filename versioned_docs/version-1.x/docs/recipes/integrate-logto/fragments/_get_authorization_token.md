Logto also helps you apply authorization to your backend APIs . Please check our [Protect your API](../../protect-your-api/README.mdx) see how to integrate Logto with your backend applications.

You can claim an authorization token for a protected API Resource request easily through Logto SDK.

In order to grant an audience restricted authorization token for your request, make sure the requested API Resource is [registered in the Logto Admin Console](../../protect-your-api//README.mdx#register-the-api-resources-using-logto-admin-console).
