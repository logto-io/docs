# üè¢ Organizations (Multi-tenancy)

<Availability cloud oss="comingSoon" />

Organization is particularly effective in business-to-business (B2B) apps. In addition to individual users, your clients can also consist of teams, organizations, or entire companies. Logto introduces Organizations as a foundational element for B2B authentication and authorization.

Even if your product is consumer-facing, organization can still be useful for collaboration features, such as sharing resources with other users.

With this fundamental element, you can build the must-have features for multi-tenancy apps, such as:

- A product that can be used by multiple organizations.
- Organization member provision on an invitation or just-in-time basis.
- Access controls that defined by roles assigned to members within an organization.
- Link organizations with Enterprise SSO (single sign-on) experience.

The term "organization" is also used in other forms, such as "workspace", "team", "company", etc. In Logto, we use "organization" as the generic term to represent the concept of multi-tenancy.

## Before we start

Hold on, you may heard of some products use the term "multi-tenancy" to represent the identity isolation: each tenant has its own set of users, permissions, and data.

It may be counterintuitive, but in fact, "multi-tenancy" indicates the contrary: multiple tenants are sharing resources in a single instance. For example, in Notion (a popular collaboration tool):

- You can create and join multiple workspaces with one account, instead of sign up for each workspace with different accounts.
- For each workspace, Notion defines a **same set** of access levels: "Worksapce owner" and "member", while you may expect different access levels for different workspaces.
