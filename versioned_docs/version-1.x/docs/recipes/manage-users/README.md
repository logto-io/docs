# 🧑‍🚀 Manage users

User management is a significant area of focus for Logto. You can access your user data and manage them using either the Admin Console or the Management API, both of which are effective. With these tools, you can perform tasks such as

- Searching for users by username, ID, full name, phone number, or email
- Performing several actions on user, such as unlinking social accounts, updating profile information, deleting users, or resetting passwords
- Checking user logs
- Assigning roles to control access.

Additionally, we have two items to highlight: you don't need a user table, and advanced user search. We will guide you through each of these actions step-by-step.
