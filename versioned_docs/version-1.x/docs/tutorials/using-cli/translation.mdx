# Translation

:::info
This command is for developers who want to contribute to Logto. If you just want to use Logto with custom translation, please refer to [this guide](/docs/recipes/customize-sie/localized-language/).
:::

## Sync keys

Let's say we made some changes to the translation keys in the `en` folder of the `phrases` package. We want to sync these changes to the `pt-BR` folder. Run the command below to sync translation keys and file structure:

```bash
pnpm cli translate sync-keys --target pt-BR
```

This command will read all translation keys from the source language folder (`en` by default) and sync them to the target language folder (`pt-BR` in this example).

- If the target language folder doesn't exist, it will be created automatically;
- If the target language folder already exists, it will be updated with new keys and removed with obsolete keys.

For each translation key:

- If a key is missing in the target, it will be added with a comment to indicate that the phrase is untranslated (marked with `// UNTRANSLATED`);
- If a key is missing in the baseline, it will be removed from the target;
- If a key exists in both the baseline and the target, the value of the target will be used.

To sync keys for all languages in the `phrases` package, run the command below:

```bash
pnpm cli translate sync-keys --target all
```

Thus we can focusing on updating the translation keys in the source language folder, and the translation keys in other languages will be updated automatically.

:::info
This command executes for `phrases` package by default. You can specify the package name by `--package` option. For example, use `--package phrases-ui` to sync keys for the `phrases-ui` package.
:::

After syncing keys, we can translate the keys using ChatGPT API.

## Translte keys using ChatGPT

Run the command below to translate keys using ChatGPT:

```bash
pnpm cli translate sync
```

This command will translate all untranslated keys (marked with `// UNTRANSLATED`) across all languages in the `phrases` and `phrases-ui` packages. Note an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required to run this command.
