# Welcome to Logto

## Logto Console

After creating your account, you will be automatically redirected to the "Get Started" tab, which provides a quick overview of what Logto can do. The onboarding items provided include both actionable resources that can be immediately utilized, as well as those that may require some level of preparation beforehand.

Our doc tutorial will follow the same order as what you see in the "Get Started" tab. Overall, these items are meant to be explored and leveraged to help you achieve success.

Depending on whether you are an open-source user, an individual developer, or an enterprise user, you may see different recommendations and guiding content. It's important to note that these recommendations are not feature differentiations between segments but rather suggestions to help you navigate and make the most of Logto.

One of our goals is to ensure that the features are available to everyone, regardless of whether they are using the open-source or cloud version.

Let's review each item and explore what you can do in Logto!
