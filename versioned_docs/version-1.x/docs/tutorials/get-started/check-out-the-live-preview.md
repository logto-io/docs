# Check out the live preview

To start exploring, you can use the live preview feature. This feature is easily accessible by clicking the "try now" button in the first card.

Clicking the "Try Now" button will open a new browser tab with a fully functional demo of Logto's capabilities. This demo showcases our experience design approach for sign-in and sign-up flows. It is highly customizable and can be seamlessly integrated into your application.

Furthermore, it functions as an excellent testing tool that can assess your sign-in experience configuration whenever you make modifications.

:::note
Please note, in this preview, you should create an account first to test the experience.

## Open-source

Logto inherently provides a sign-in experience that requires a username and password, without the need for additional configuration. To try it out, simply create an account using your desired username and password.

## Cloud preview

The Cloud preview version differs from the open-source version, as the live preview reflects the configurations made during onboarding and shows a sign-in experience tailored to your initial set-up.

It's important to note that both the Cloud preview and open-source versions of Logto follow the same identity model and architecture . Therefore, be sure to create an account before attempting to sign in.

## Test the live preview

If you try to sign in with the user account you created and the process is successful with no issues, you will be redirected to a success page that displays your identifiers and ID.
