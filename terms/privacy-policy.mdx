## Information We Collect

We only collect the minimum amount of personal information necessary to provide our services. This includes your name, email address, and other necessary information required for authentication and authorization. We do not collect any sensitive personal information.

## Use of Cookies

We only use strictly necessary cookies to ensure secure authentication and authorization for our services. These cookies do not contain any personal information and are deleted once you sign out of our service.

We use Application Insights, a web analytics service provided by Microsoft Azure, to monitor and improve the performance and usage of our services. This service may collect and analyze non-personally identifiable information such as user behaviors, device information, and usage patterns. The information collected by Application Insights is used solely for the purpose of improving our services.

## About Google user data

### Access to Google user data

Logto only accesses Google user data with explicit user consent. When a user signs up for Logto, they grant us access to certain Google account information, such as name, email address, and profile picture.

### Use of Google user data

Logto uses Google user data solely for the purpose of providing our services to the user. This includes enabling the user to sign in to our app, and providing access to necessary features within Logto Cloud.

### Storage of Google user data

Logto stores Google user data on secure servers located in data centers within the West Europe region. Please refer to the [Data Security](#data-security) section for more information on how we ensure the safety and security of user data.

### Sharing of Google user data

Logto does not share Google user data with any third parties, except as required by law or to comply with legal process. Please refer to the [Information Sharing](#data-security) section for details.

## Information Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share any personal information with third parties, except as required by law, or to comply with legal process, or as necessary to provide our services.

If we need to share your personal information with third-party service providers who assist us in providing our services, we will list all such third-party providers in our Privacy Policy and explain the purpose of the sharing, and only share your information to the extent necessary to provide the service.

## Data Security

We take the security of your personal information seriously and have implemented various security measures to protect it, including:

1. Secure Communication: The communication between any public party to Logto services is enforced by [TLS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) (Transport Layer Security) to ensure that all data transmitted between you and our service is encrypted and secure.
2. Private Database Network: The Logto database stays in a private network in the [Azure West Europe region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#choose-your-region), with no direct access to the public internet. This ensures that your data is stored in a secure and protected environment.
3. Data Isolation: Every tenant has a dedicated database role and every business table has enforced [Row-Level Security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/ddl-rowsecurity.html) to ensure that your data is isolated in the database. This means that only authorized users have access to the data, and each tenant's data is separated from other tenants.
4. Password Encryption: Logto will not store passwords in plain text. All passwords are encrypted using the [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) algorithm, which is a secure password hashing algorithm. This ensures that even if a data breach were to occur, your password would not be compromised.

We regularly review our security practices and update them as necessary to ensure that your personal information is protected. If you have any questions or concerns about the security of your personal information, please contact us at [security@logto.io](mailto:security@logto.io).

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our website.
