## Information We Collect and the Lawful Basis for Processing

We collect the minimum amount of personal information necessary to provide our services, which includes your name, email address, and other necessary information required for authentication and authorization.

We process this personal information on the basis of the necessity for the performance of our contract with you to provide our services. If you do not provide this information, we may not be able to deliver our services effectively.

In the course of providing our services, we may share your personal data with certain third parties. These include our service providers who assist in providing our services, law enforcement agencies if required by law, and third-party platforms like Google for advertising purposes.

Your personal data will not be sold or rented to any third parties.

### Automated Decision Making and Profiling

## Data Subject Rights

As a data subject, you have certain rights under the GDPR, including the right to access, correct, update, or request deletion of your personal data. You also have the right to object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information. You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [contact@logto.io](mailto:contact@logto.io). We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and always within the legal maximum period of one month.

## Data Retention Period

We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the services you have requested and thereafter for legitimate legal or business purposes. These might include retention periods mandated by legal, contractual, or similar obligations applicable to our business operations; for preserving, resolving, defending, or enforcing our legal/contractual rights; or needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records.

## Cross-Border Data Transfers

We store your personal data on secure servers located in data centers within the West Europe region. We may transfer personal data to a country outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) if necessary, for example, to a jurisdiction where our service providers are located. When we do, we ensure that an appropriate level of protection is in place to protect the personal data.

## Use of Cookies

We only use strictly necessary cookies to ensure secure authentication and authorization for our services. These cookies do not contain any personal information and are deleted once you sign out of our service.

## Use of Plausible Analytics

We use an analytics product called Plausible to help us improve your experience using Logto services. Plausible does not use cookies, and it does not collect any personal information. Plausible collects non-personally identifiable data such as page views, browser type, and device type.

## Use of Application Insights

We use Application Insights, a web analytics service provided by Microsoft Azure, to monitor and improve the performance and usage of our services. This service may collect and analyze non-personally identifiable information such as user behaviors, device information, and usage patterns.

## Use of Google Ad Conversion Tracking

We use Google's ad conversion tracking service to understand the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is placed on your device.

## About Google and GitHub User Data

### Sharing of Google and GitHub User Data

Logto does not share Google and GitHub user data with any third parties, except as required by law or to comply with legal process.

## Information Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share any personal information with third parties, except as required by law, or to comply with legal process, or as necessary to provide our services.

## Data Security

We take the security of your personal information seriously and have implemented various security measures to protect it, including but not limited to:

1. Secure Communication: The communication between any public party to Logto services is enforced by [TLS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) (Transport Layer Security) to ensure that all data transmitted between you and our service is encrypted and secure.
2. Private Database Network: The Logto database stays in a private network in the [Azure West Europe region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#choose-your-region), with no direct access to the public internet. This ensures that your data is stored in a secure and protected environment.
3. Data Isolation: Every tenant has a dedicated database role and every business table has enforced [Row-Level Security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/ddl-rowsecurity.html) to ensure that your data is isolated in the database. This means that only authorized users have access to the data, and each tenant's data is separated from other tenants.
4. Password Encryption: Logto will not store passwords in plain text. All passwords are encrypted using the [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) algorithm, which is a secure password hashing algorithm. This ensures that even if a data breach were to occur, your password would not be compromised.
5. Database Encryption: All data stored in the Logto database is encrypted at rest. See [Information protection and encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-security#information-protection-and-encryption) for more information.

We regularly review our security practices and update them as necessary to ensure that your personal information is protected. If you have any questions or concerns about the security of your personal information, please contact us at [security@logto.io](mailto:security@logto.io).

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our website.
