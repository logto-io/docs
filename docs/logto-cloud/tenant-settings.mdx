# Tenant settings

## Tenant region

When you create a tenant, you can choose the region where the tenant data is stored. It cannot be changed after the tenant is created. Here are the available regions:

- EU (Netherlands)
- US (West United States)
- AU (Australia)

Usually, you should choose the region closest to your customers to minimize latency and improve performance.

Logto leverages the global edge network to deliver the best performance and availability for your applications. The request routing is optimized to ensure that your users are always connected with the best-performing option.

## Tenant types: Dev vs. Prod

There are two types of tenants in Logto Cloud: development and production. With this tenant differentiation, you can better manage your projects across different environments for efficiency and, at the same time, enjoy the full value of Logto.

Please be aware that you can only specify your tenant types during creation; the tenant type cannot be edited once it's created.

## Development

The development tenant (dev tenant) is primarily intended for testing purposes and should not be utilized in a production environment. These tenants allow access to premium and paid features available in paid plans, free of charge and without requiring a subscription.

However, there are certain limitations that apply to development tenants:

- Dev tenant will automatically delete users and organizations over 90 days.
- A banner appears during the sign-in experience, indicating that the tenant is in development mode.
- Development tenants may have quota limits on specific features. These limits are explained on the feature details page, if applicable.
- Logto may update the development tenant's quota limits, and we will try our best to notify you in advance.
