# Billing and pricing

In Logto, our Pro plan is fully self-serve, designed for transparency so you can easily understand and manage your billing.

## Understand the structure

The basic structure looks like this:

```math
\text{Your next bill} = \$16\text{ (base price)} + \text{add-on cost (unbilled usage)} + \text{add-on cost (next cycle charge)}
```

In the console, you'll find a "Your next bill" section in the tenant setting section, where you can monitor and control your upcoming charges.

## Item breakdown

Keep in mind that only a few features are part of the add-on structure.

At the same time, Logto also offers a pay-as-you-go and pro-rated pricing model to ensure you get the most out of our service conveniently.

|                                 | Free quota | Addition cost                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Tokens**                      | 1 million  | $80 **_per million_** tokens |
| **Machine-to-machine apps**     | 1          | $8 **_each_** per month      |
| **API resources**               | 3          | $4 **_each_** per month      |
| **Enterprise SSO**              | 0          | $48 **_each_** per month     |
| **Multi-factor authentication** | _N/A_      | $48 per month                |
| **Organization**                | _N/A_      | $48 per month                |
| **Tenant members**              | 3          | $8 **_each_** per month      |

If we take those factors into consideration, the algorithm is

```math
\begin{align*}
\text{Your next bill} &= \$16 \\
&+ \text{add on unit price} \times \\
\quad & (\text{quantity added} \times \text{pro-rated time remaining upon creation} \\
\quad &- \text{quantity removed} \times \text{pro-rated time remaining upon deletion}) \\
\quad &+ \text{add on unit price} \times \text{quantity remaining}
\end{align*}
```

1. **add on unit price**: The unit price of this add-on
2. **quantity added**: The amount of add-on user added in **_current_** billing cycle
3. **quantity removed**: The amount of add-on user removed in **_current_** billing cycle
4. **pro-rated time remaining upon creation**: pro-rated time remaining in the **_current_** cycle when you CREATE the resources
5. **pro-rated time remaining upon deletion**: pro-rated time remaining in **_current_** cycle when you DELETE the resources
6. **quantity remaining**: the amount needed for consistent billing in the **_next_** cycle

Let's take two examples to see how it works.

### Example 1: Consistent billing with no changes

Your bill will stay consistent if you don't make any changes, like adding or removing items.

For example, if you're on the Pro plan and have 2 SSO services in use, your bill will remain consistent as long as you don't make any changes.

```math
\text{Your next bill} = \$ 16 + \$ 48 \times 2 = \$ 112
```

### Example 2: Adding add-ons or making changes will affect your upcoming bills

This will make your upcoming bill a little different based on different cases. The algorithm still works.

**Case 1: You subscribed to the Pro plan without any add-ons and only tested the Enterprise SSO for 10 days.**

If your subscription renews on the 5th of each month and you add an Enterprise SSO on the 20th, you'll use it for 15 days that month. If you delete the Enterprise SSO on the 30th, it means you only used it for 10 days.

```math
\$16 + \$48 \times (1 \times 15 / 30) - \$48 \times (1 \times 5 / 30) = \$32
```

**Case 2: You subscribed to the Pro plan without any add-ons. After adding and removing API resources, you ended up using 5 API resources**

In this case, You updated add-on features during this billing cycle, so the changes will show up on your next bill. The first month after the change might be slightly higher. Your bill will include the $16 base price, add-on costs for unbilled usage, and the full charge for the next recurring cycle.

Your billing cycle starts on the 1st of each month, and you've used the first 3 free API resources. This month, you performed two actions:

1. On the 5th, you added 4 more resources.
2. On the 15th, you deleted 2 of those resources.

As a result, you'll consistently have 2 API resources available for the upcoming cycle.

```math
\$16 + \$8 \times (4 \times 25 - 2 \times 15) / 30 + 2 \times \$8 = \$50.67
```

### How is the add-on usage time determined?

We use a pay-as-you-go model, and you might wonder what happens if you frequently add or remove resources. The add-on is considered in use for the exact duration it is active. Don't worryâ€”our system, powered by Stripe, calculates your usage down to the second, ensuring accurate billing based on exactly how long each resource is in use.

If you unsubscribe from the Pro plan, we'll refund the unused add-on cost, and the amount will be deducted from your final bill.

## Upgrade or downgrade

### Free plan upgrade Pro

Upgrades and downgrades apply only to the production tenant. Here are situations when you may need to consider upgrading from the Free plan:

1. If your MAU or Token usage exceeds the quota, we'll send you an email alert at the appropriate time, notifying you of the need to upgrade.
2. If you want to access features available only in the premium plan.

### Pro plan upgrade to Enterprise

If the Pro plan doesn't meet your needs and you're looking for full enterprise-level support, please contact us to discuss a custom enterprise plan.

### Pro plan downgrade to Free plan

If you choose to stop using the Pro plan, you can switch to the Free plan, but you'll need to adjust your usage to fit within the Free plan's quota.

## Future pricing plan change

To provide you with a stable and predictable billing experience, we will grandfather your current plan whenever pricing changes occur.
