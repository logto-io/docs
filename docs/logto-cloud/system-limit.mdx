# System limit

System limits define the maximum number of entities a tenant can create. They protect platform stability and are independent of billing. Some items on the pricing page are marked as _unlimited_ or _pay-as-you-go_. This means there is no billing cap, but internal system caps still apply to ensure fair use. We can review increases case by case.

## Types of limits \{#types-of-limits}

### System resource and entity caps \{#system-resource-and-entity-caps}

Maximum counts for objects such as applications, roles, organizations, connectors, and certain usage-based system resources such as total token consumption. These limits vary by plan.

### Rate limit \{#rate-limit}

Request-level protection applied per tenant. The general guideline is **200 requests per 10 seconds per tenant**. If your traffic is legitimate and consistently exceeds this, we can evaluate an override case by case.

If your use case is valid and you hit a limit, contact us. This helps us adjust limits and support real-world scenarios.

### Dev tenants \{#dev-tenants}

[Dev tenants](/logto-cloud/tenant-settings#development) provide free access for testing. To prevent abuse and to keep expectations clear, Dev tenants have fixed entity caps. If you need more, you can request an increase or upgrade to Pro for full access.

Dev tenants also follow a separate [data retention policy](/logto-cloud/dev-tenant-data-retention).
