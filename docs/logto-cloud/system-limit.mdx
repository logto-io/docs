# System limit

At Logto, we've set generous limits across all plans and provide flexible pay-as-you-go options, so users only pay for what they actually use.

You may notice that some items on the pricing page are marked as _unlimited_ or as _continuous pay-as-you-go without a ceiling_. This means they can generally be used without restriction, but Logto reserves the right to adjust these actual limits over time to maintain fair use for all users. In other words, entity limits are strict caps that protect the platform's overall health. They are not part of pricing, though they may vary across different plan groups.

If your use case is reasonable but reaches a system limit, feel free to [contact us](https://logto.io/contact) and share your feedback. This helps us better understand real-world usage patterns and adjust system limits to better support our loyal customers.

### Dev tenants \{#dev-tenants}

For [Development tenants](/logto-cloud/tenant-settings#development), users can take advantage of Logto's free features and offerings. To prevent abuse and set clear expectations, we define certain system limits. These limits help us manage our platform sustainably while still providing free access for testing and development purposes.

If you'd like to increase your quota, you can contact us for assistance. We also recommend [upgrading from **Dev** to **Pro**](/logto-cloud/billing-and-pricing#dev-tenant-upgrade-to-pro), which removes the cap and gives you full access immediately.
