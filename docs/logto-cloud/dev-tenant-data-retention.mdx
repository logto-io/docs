# Dev tenant data retention policy

Logto Cloud follows a clear principle: **production is for persistence, development is for testing**.

- In **production tenants** (Free, Pro, and Enterprise), objects and entities are kept for the full lifespan of the account, unless you remove them or request otherwise.
- In **dev tenants**, the goal is different. They are **safe sandboxes for testing,** focused on security, performance, and clean environments rather than storing data long term.

To uphold this principle, Logto applies a 90-day retention policy in dev tenants: **users** in dev tenants are automatically deleted after 90 days.

In dev environments, developers often create many test accounts during integration. These accounts generate large amounts of data but rarely provide long-term value. The 90-day policy ensures Logto's platform resources are used efficiently, keeps test environments clean and performant, prevents unused accounts from piling up, and clearly separates temporary test data from long-term production data.

## Understanding the 90-day policy \{#understanding-the-90-day-policy}

### Only user accounts older than 90 days are deleted \{#only-user-accounts-older-than-90-days-are-deleted}

Deleting users means removing all profiles information, authentication data, and related information.

### What stays intact \{#what-stays-intact}

Your development work and configurations remain untouched. This makes it easy to carry over your dev and integration setup into production environments in the future. We offer options to directly [convert your dev tenant](./tenant-settings#tenant-types-dev-vs-prod) to production tenant.

## What automatic user deletion means for you \{#what-automatic-user-deletion-means-for-you}

- Privacy protection: Test accounts are often shared across teams during development or left unused for long periods. We recommend refreshing them every 90 days.
- Resource efficiency: Automatic deletion frees up storage and processing capacity, keeping environments clean and efficient.
- Clear separation of environments: Dev tenants are temporary sandboxes. Long-term, persistent data belongs in production tenants.

## Best practices for dev tenants \{#best-practices-for-dev-tenants}

### During development \{#during-development}

- Use Logto dev tenants as your sandbox for testing.
- Keep notes on important test scenarios so you can easily recreate them.
- Plan your development lifecycle carefully and move to production when the time is right.

### For long-term projects \{#for-long-term-projects}

- Create new test users or accounts as needed instead of keeping old ones.
- Use production tenants if you need staging environments with persistent data.

## Summary \{#summary}

1. Users in dev tenants are automatically cleaned up after 90 days
2. All your configurations, apps, and settings remain permanent
3. This policy ensures security, performance, and clean testing conditions
4. Production tenants have different retention policies for persistent data
5. Plan your development workflow around this automated cleanup cycle

This retention policy ensures that your development environment remains a secure, efficient, and reliable testing ground while protecting user privacy and maintaining system performance.

For persistent user data storage, consider upgrading to a production tenant where data retention follows your organization's specific requirements.
