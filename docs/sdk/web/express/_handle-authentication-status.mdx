In Logto SDK, you can use the `withLogto` middleware to get `req.user.isAuthenticated` to check the authentication status, if the user is signed in, the value will be `true`, otherwise, the value will be `false`.

```ts
import { withLogto } from '@logto/express';

app.use(withLogto(config));
```

No, let's use this value to protect routes by creating a simple middleware:

```ts
const requireAuth = async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  if (!req.user.isAuthenticated) {
    res.redirect('/logto/sign-in');
  }

  next();
};
```

And then use it in the route handler:

```ts
app.get('/protected', requireAuth, (req, res) => {
  res.end('protected resource');
});
```

#### Fetch user info

For most cases, it is recommended to use `claims` in `req.user` as "user info", this can be fast because `claims` is cached when tokens are granted. If you need more accurate user info, set `config.fetchUserInfo` to `true`, to tell the SDK to fetch the user information from the OIDC [UserInfo Endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo).

```ts
app.get('/user', withLogto({ ...config, fetchUserInfo: true }), (req, res) => {
  res.json(req.user.userInfo);
});
```
