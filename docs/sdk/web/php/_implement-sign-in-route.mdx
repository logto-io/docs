<SignInFlowSummary />

Before you start implementing the sign-in flow, you need to add a redirect URI in the Admin Console for your application.

<ConfigureRedirectUri
  figureSrc={redirectUriFigure}
  redirectUri="http://localhost:8080/sign-in-callback"
/>

In your web application, add a route to properly handle the sign-in request from users. Let's use `/sign-in` as an example:

```php
Route::get('/sign-in', function () {
  return redirect($client->signIn('http://localhost:8080/sign-in-callback'));
});
```

Replace `http://localhost:8080/sign-in-callback` with the callback URL you set in your Logto Console for this application.

If you want to show the sign-up page on the first screen, you can set `interactionMode` to `signUp`:

```php
Route::get('/sign-in', function () {
  return redirect($client->signIn('http://localhost:8080/sign-in-callback', InteractionMode::signUp));
});
```

Now, whenever your users visit `http://localhost:8080/sign-in`, it will start a new sign-in attempt and redirect the user to the Logto sign-in page.

> **Note**
> Creating a sign-in route isn't the only way to start a sign-in attempt. You can always use the `signIn` method to get the sign-in URL and redirect the user to it.

We also need to implement a home page for demonstration:

- If the user is not signed in, show a sign-in button;
- If the user is signed in, show some basic information about the user.

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
  if ($client->isAuthenticated() === false) {
    return "Not authenticated <a href='/sign-in'>Sign in</a>";
  }

  return (
    // Get local ID token claims
    json_decode($client->getIdTokenClaims())
    . "<br>"
    // Fetch user info from Logto userinfo endpoint
    json_decode($client->fetchUserInfo())
    . "<br><a href='/sign-out'>Sign out</a>"
  );
});
```

Our data models are based on [JsonModel](https://github.com/logto-io/php/blob/master/docs/api/classes/Logto/Sdk/Models/JsonModel.md), which is safe to accept undefined keys while encoding or decoding JSON.

Note that a field (claim) with `null` value doesn't mean the field is set. The reason may be the related scope is not requested, or the user doesn't have the field.

For example, if we didn't request the `email` scope when signing in, and the `email` field will be `null`. However, if we requested the `email` scope, the `email` field will be the user's email address if available.

To learn more about scopes and claims, see [Scopes and claims](#scopes-and-claims).
