<SignInFlowSummary />

Before you start implementing the sign-in flow, you need to add a redirect URI in the Admin Console for your application.

<ConfigureRedirectUri
  figureSrc={redirectUriFigure}
  redirectUri="http://localhost:8080/sign-in-callback"
/>

In your web application, add a route to properly handle the sign-in request from users. Let's use `/sign-in` as an example:

```php
Route::get('/sign-in', function () {
  return redirect($client->signIn('http://localhost:8080/sign-in-callback'));
});
```

Replace `http://localhost:8080/sign-in-callback` with the callback URL you set in your Logto Console for this application.

If you want to show the sign-up page on the first screen, you can set `interactionMode` to `signUp`:

```php
Route::get('/sign-in', function () {
  return redirect($client->signIn('http://localhost:8080/sign-in-callback', InteractionMode::signUp));
});
```

Now, whenever your users visit `http://localhost:8080/sign-in`, it will start a new sign-in attempt and redirect the user to the Logto sign-in page.

> **Note**
> Creating a sign-in route isn't the only way to start a sign-in attempt. You can always use the `signIn` method to get the sign-in URL and redirect the user to it.
