We're almost there! In the last step, we use `http://localhost:3000/callback` as the Redirect URI, and now we need to handle it properly.

First let's create a callback component:

```tsx
import { useHandleSignInCallback } from '@logto/react';

const Callback = () => {
  const { isLoading } = useHandleSignInCallback(() => {
    // Navigate to root path when finished
  });

  // When it's working in progress
  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Redirecting...</div>;
  }
};
```

Finally insert the code below to create a `/callback` route which does NOT require authentication:

```tsx
// Assuming react-router
<Route path="/callback" element={<Callback />} />
```
