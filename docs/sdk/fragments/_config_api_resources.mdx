Once you have set up the API resources, you can add them when configuring the Logto client:

{props.configResourcesCode}

Each API resource has its own permissions (scopes).

For example, the `https://shopping.your-app.com/api` resource has the `shopping:read` and `shopping:write` permissions, and the `https://store.your-app.com/api` resource has the `store:read` and `store:write` permissions.

To request these permissions, you can add them when configuring the Logto client:

{props.configResourcesWithScopesCode}

You may notice that scopes are defined separately from API resources. This is because [Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html) specifies the final scopes for the request will be the cartesian product of all the scopes at all the target services.

Thus, in the above case, scopes can be simplified from the definition in Logto, both of the API resources can have `read` and `write` scopes without the prefix. Then, in the Logto config:

{props.configResourcesWithSharedScopesCode}

For every API resource, it will request for both `read` and `write` scopes.

:::note
It is fine to request scopes that are not defined in the API resources. For example, you can request the `email` scope even if the API resources don't have the `email` scope available. Unavailable scopes will be safely ignored.

After the successful sign-in, Logto will issue proper scopes to every API resource according to the user's roles.
