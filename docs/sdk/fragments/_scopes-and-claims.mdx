Logto uses OIDC [scopes and claims conventions](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims) to define the scopes and claims for retrieving user information from the ID token and OIDC <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo">userinfo endpoint</a>. Both of the "scope" and the "claim" are terms from the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) specifications.

In short, when you request a scope, you will get the corresponding claims in the user information. For example, if you request the `email` scope, you will get the `email` and `email_verified` data of the user.

By default, Logto SDK will always request three scopes: `openid`, `profile`. And `offline_access`, and there is no way to remove these default scopes. But you can add more scopes when configuring Logto:

{props.configScopesCode}

<ScopeClaimList />
