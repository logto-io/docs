Both of "scope" and "claim" are terms from the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) specifications. In OIDC, there are some optional [scopes and claims conventions](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims) to follow. Logto uses these conventions to define the scopes and claims for the ID token.

In short, when you request a scope, you will get the corresponding claims in the ID token. For example, if you request the `email` scope, you will get the `email` and `email_verified` claims in the ID token.

{props.fetchUserInfoApi &&

And this mechanism is also applied to the OIDC <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo">Userinfo Endpoint</a>, you can fetch the user information from the &quot;Userinfo Endpoint&quot; by calling <code>{props.fetchUserInfoApi}</code> API in Logto SDK.

By default, Logto SDK will always requests three scopes: `openid`, `profile`, and `offline_access`, and there is no way to remove these default scopes. But you can add more scopes when configuring the Logto:

{props.configScopesCode}

<ScopeClaimList />
