Both of "scope" and "claim" are terms from the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) specifications. In OIDC, there are some optional [scopes and claims conventions](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims) to follow. Logto uses these conventions to define the scopes and claims for the ID token.

In short, when you request a scope, you will get the corresponding claims in the ID token. For example, if you request the `email` scope, you will get the `email` and `email_verified` claims in the ID token.

And this mechanism is also applied to the OIDC [Userinfo Endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo), you can fetch the user information from the "Userinfo Endpoint" by calling <code>{props.fetchUserInfoApi}</code> API in Logto SDK.

By default, Logto SDK will always requests three scopes: `openid`, `profile`, and `offline_access`, and there is no way to remove these default scopes. But you can add more scopes when configuring the Logto :

{props.configScopesCode}

The following table lists the relations between user information and scopes:

| Field Name            | Description                                                                                                  | Type       | Required Scope                       |

### Special ID token claims

Considering performance and the data size, Logto doesn't include all the claims in the ID token, such as `custom_data` which could be a large JSON object. To fetch these claims, you can use the <code>{props.fetchUserInfoApi}</code> API provided by Logto SDK.
