You can use Logto API to retrieve user information:

- <code>{props.getIdTokenClaimsApi}</code>: get user information from ID token.
- <code>{props.fetchUserInfoApi}</code>: fetch user information from the OIDC [Userinfo
  Endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo) provided by Logto.

It's important to note that the user information claims that can be retrieved depending on the
scopes used by the user during signing-in, and considering performance and data size, the ID token
may not contain all user claims, some user claims are only available in the userinfo endpoint (see
the related list below).
