To fetch the access token for a specific API resource, you can use the <code>{props.getAccessTokenApi}</code> method:

{props.getAccessTokenCode}

This method will return a JWT access token that can be used to access the API resource when the user has related permissions. If the current cached access token has expired, this method will automatically try to use a refresh token to get a new access token.
