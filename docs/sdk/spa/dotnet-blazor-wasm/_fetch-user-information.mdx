The above config uses the `openid` and `profile` scopes. These two scopes will inform Logto to return the basic user information in the `id_token` response (you can access the claims `User.Profile`).

- To fetch more information, you can add valid scopes to the `IdentityServer.Scope` property in the `appsettings.json` file.
- Considering performance and the data size, Logto doesn't include all the claims in the ID token, such as `custom_data` which could be a large JSON object. To enable this feature, set the `IdentityServer.LoadUserInfo` property to `true` in the `appsettings.json` file.

For example, to fetch the user's email address and custom data, you can use the following configuration:

{/* eslint-disable prettier/prettier */}
```json5
{
  // ...
  "IdentityServer": {
    // ...
    "Scope": "openid profile email custom_data",
    "LoadUserInfo": true
  }
}
```
{/* eslint-enable prettier/prettier */}

<ScopeClaimList />
