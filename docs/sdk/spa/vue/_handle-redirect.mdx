### Handle redirect

We're almost there! In the last step, we use `http://localhost:3000/callback` as the Redirect URI, and now we need to handle it properly.

First let's create a callback component:

```ts
// CallbackView.vue
import { useHandleSignInCallback } from '@logto/vue';
const { isLoading } = useHandleSignInCallback(() => {
  // Navigate to root path when finished
});
```

```html
<template>
  <!-- When it's working in progress -->
  <p v-if="isLoading">Redirecting...</p>
</template>
```

Finally insert the code below in your `/callback` route which does NOT require authentication:

```ts
// Assuming vue-router
const router = createRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/callback',
      name: 'callback',
      component: CallbackView,
    },
  ],
});
```
