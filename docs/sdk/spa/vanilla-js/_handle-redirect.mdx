We're almost there! In the last step, we use `http://localhost:3000/callback` as the Redirect URI, and now we need to handle it properly. Call the callback handler in your SPA's `/callback` route to complete the sign-in flow.

```js
const callbackHandler = async (logtoClient) => {
  await logtoClient.handleSignInCallback(window.location.href);

  if (!logtoClient.isAuthenticated) {
    // Handle failed sign-in
    alert('Failed to sign in');
    return;
  }

  // Handle successful sign-in
  window.location.assign('http://localhost:3000/');
};
```
