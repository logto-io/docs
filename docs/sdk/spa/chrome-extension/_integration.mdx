### The authentication flow

Assuming you put a "Sign in" button in your Chrome extension's popup, the authentication flow will look like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as Extension popup
  participant B as Extension service worker
  participant C as Logto sign-in experience

  A->>B: Invokes sign-in
  B->>C: Redirects to Logto
  C->>C: User signs in
  C->>B: Redirects back to extension
  B->>A: Notifies the popup
```

For other interactive pages in your extension, you just need to replace the `Extension popup` participant with the page's name. In this tutorial, we will focus on the popup page.

### Update the `manifest.json`

Logto SDK requires the following permissions in the `manifest.json`:

```json title="manifest.json"
{
  "permissions": ["identity", "storage"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*.logto.app/*"]
}
```

- `permissions.identity`: Required for the Chrome Identity API, which is used to sign in and sign out.
- `permissions.storage`: Required for storing the user's session.
- `host_permissions`: Required for the Logto SDK to communicate with the Logto APIs.

:::note
If you are using a custom domain on Logto Cloud, you need to update the `host_permissions` to match your domain.
:::

### Set up a background script (service worker)

In your Chrome extension's background script, initialize the Logto SDK:

```js title="service-worker.js"
import LogtoClient from '@logto/chrome-extension';

export const logtoClient = new LogtoClient({
  endpoint: '<your-logto-endpoint>'
  appId: '<your-logto-app-id>',
});
```

Replace `<your-logto-endpoint>` and `<your-logto-app-id>` with the actual values. You can find these values in the application page you just created in the Logto Console.

If you don't have a background script, you can follow the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/service-workers/basics) to create one.

:::info
**Why do we need a background script?**

Normal extension pages like the popup or options page can't run in the background, and they have the possibility to be closed during the authentication process. A background script ensures the authentication process can be properly handled.
:::

Then, we need to listen to the message from other extension pages and handle the authentication process:

```js title="service-worker.js"
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  // In the below code, since we return `true` for each action, we need to call `sendResponse`
  // to notify the sender. You can also handle errors here, or use other ways to notify the sender.

  if (message.action === 'signIn') {
    const redirectUri = chrome.identity.getRedirectURL('/callback');
    logtoClient.signIn(redirectUri).finally(sendResponse);
    return true;
  }

  if (message.action === 'signOut') {
    const redirectUri = chrome.identity.getRedirectURL();
    logtoClient.signOut(redirectUri).finally(sendResponse);
    return true;
  }

  return false;
});
```

You may notice there are two redirect URIs used in the code above. They are both created by `chrome.identity.getRedirectURL`, which is a [built-in Chrome API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/identity#method-getRedirectURL) to generate a redirect URL for auth flows. The two URIs will be:

- `https://<extension-id>.chromiumapp.org/callback` for sign-in.
- `https://<extension-id>.chromiumapp.org/` for sign-out.

Note that these URIs are not accessible, and they are only used for Chrome to trigger specific actions for the authentication process.

### Update Logto application settings

Now we need to update the Logto application settings to allow the redirect URIs we just created.

1. Go to the application page in the Logto Console.
2. In the "Redirect URIs" section, add the URI: `https://<extension-id>.chromiumapp.org/callback`.
3. In the "Post sign-out redirect URIs" section, add the URI: `https://<extension-id>.chromiumapp.org/`.
4. In the "CORS allowed origins" section, add the URI: `chrome-extension://<extension-id>`. The SDK in Chrome extension will use this origin to communicate with the Logto APIs.
5. Click on **Save changes**.

Remember to replace `<extension-id>` with your actual extension ID. You can find the extension ID in the `chrome://extensions` page.

### Add sign-in and sign-out buttons to the popup

We're almost there! Let's add the sign-in and sign-out buttons and other necessary logic to the popup page.

In the `popup.html` file:

```html title="popup.html"
<button id="sign-in">Sign in</button> <button id="sign-out">Sign out</button>
```

In the `popup.js` file (assuming `popup.js` is included in the `popup.html`):

```js title="popup.js"
document.getElementById('sign-in').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  await chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: 'signIn' });
  // Sign-in completed (or failed), you can update the UI here.
});

document.getElementById('sign-out').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  await chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: 'signOut' });
  // Sign-out completed (or failed), you can update the UI here.
});
```

### Checkpoint: Test the authentication flow

Now you can test the authentication flow in your Chrome extension:

1. Open the extension popup.
2. Click on the "Sign in" button.
3. You will be redirected to the Logto sign-in page.
4. Sign in with your Logto account.
5. You will be redirected back to the Chrome.

### Check authentication state

Since Chrome provide unified storage APIs, rather than the sign-in and sign-out flow, all other Logto SDK methods can be used in the popup page directly.

In your `popup.js`, you can reuse the `LogtoClient` instance created in the background script, or create a new one with the same configuration:

```js title="popup.js"
import LogtoClient from '@logto/chrome-extension';

const logtoClient = new LogtoClient({
  endpoint: '<your-logto-endpoint>'
  appId: '<your-logto-app-id>',
});

// Or reuse the logtoClient instance created in the background script
import { logtoClient } from './service-worker.js';
```

Then you can create a function to load the authentication state and user's profile:

```js title="popup.js"
const loadAuthenticationState = async () => {
  const isAuthenticated = await logtoClient.isAuthenticated();
  // Update the UI based on the authentication state

  if (isAuthenticated) {
    const user = await logtoClient.getIdTokenClaims(); // { sub: '...', email: '...', ... }
    // Update the UI with the user's profile
  }
};
```

You can also combine the `loadAuthenticationState` function with the sign-in and sign-out logic:

```js title="popup.js"
document.getElementById('sign-in').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  await chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: 'signIn' });
  await loadAuthenticationState();
});

document.getElementById('sign-out').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  await chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: 'signOut' });
  await loadAuthenticationState();
});
```

Here's an example of the popup page with the authentication state:

![Popup page](./extension-popup.webp)

### Other considerations

- **Service worker bundling**: If you use a bundler like Webpack or Rollup, you need to explicitly set the target to `browser` or similar to avoid unnecessary bundling of Node.js modules.
- **Module resolution**: Logto Chrome extension SDK is an ESM-only module.

See our [sample project](https://github.com/logto-io/js/tree/HEAD/packages/chrome-extension-sample) for a complete example with TypeScript, Rollup, and other configurations.
