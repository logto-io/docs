# 🎉 Welcome to Logto

## Logto Console

After creating your account, you will be automatically redirected to the "Get started" tab, which provides a quick overview of what Logto can do. The onboarding items provided include both actionable resources that can be immediately utilized, as well as those that may require some level of preparation beforehand.

Our doc tutorial will follow the same order as what you see in the "Get started" tab. Overall, these items are meant to be explored and leveraged to help you achieve success.

Depending on whether you are an open-source user, an individual developer, or an enterprise user, you may see different recommendations and guiding content. It's important to note that these recommendations are not feature differentiations between segments but rather suggestions to help you navigate and make the most of Logto.

One of our goals is to ensure that the features are available to everyone, regardless of whether they are using the open-source or cloud version.

Let's review each item and explore what you can do in Logto!

## Invite your team members

Logto lets you invite team members to your tenant with two different roles in Logto Cloud:

- **Admin:** Full access and management of all tenant resources.
- **Collaborator:** Can manage identity-related resources, but with limitations:
  - No access to billing information
  - Cannot invite or manage other members
  - Cannot change the tenant name
  - Cannot delete the tenant

### Member limit

| Tenant type            | Member limit                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Dev tenant             | Up to 20 members (contact us for more)               |
| Free production tenant | 1 member (admin only)                                |
| Pro production tenant  | Starts with 3 members, then $8 per additional member |

### Invite team members

Go to **_Tenant Settings → Members_**. You'll see your current members and can invite more. Enter email addresses and assign roles (you can do this in bulk) and then send.

You can't invite people who already have pending invitations or are members.

### Manage invitation

The invitation tab shows past invitations with their status

| Status   | Explanation                            | Available action   |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Pending  | Invitation sent, but not yet accepted. | Resend<br />Revoke |
| Accepted | User is now a tenant member.           | Delete             |
| Expired  | Invitation exceeded the 7-day limit.   | Delete             |
| Revoked  | Admin cancelled the invitation.        | Delete             |

### Manage tenant members (Admin only)

As an admin, you have several ways to manage your team:

- **Invite or remove members:** Add new team members or remove access as needed.
- **Change member roles:** Assign 'admin' or 'collaborator' roles depending on the required access level.
- **Transfer tenant ownership:** If needed, you can transfer the ownership of the tenant to another member. You can first give the admin role to another member and then choose to stay as a regular member or leave the tenant entirely.
- **Add multiple admins:** Share administrative responsibilities with other team members for collaborative management.
