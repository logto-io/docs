# Enable SMS or email passcode sign-in

In the "Get Started" tab, click the "Enable" button on the right, and the browser will redirect to the Connectors tab.

The enabling process for SMS and email are very close, so we combine them into one tutorial.

<ConnectorsIntro />

## Choose a connector

Depending on what kind of connector you want to enable, click the "Set Up" button on the left of the Type column. The opening modal will ask you the specific connector you want to set up.

Logto has some built-in connectors which allows out-of-box usage:

<Columns columns={[
  { title: 'SMS connectors', items: [{ key: 'Twilio SMS' }, { key: 'Aliyun SMS' }] },
  { title: 'Email connectors', items: [{ key: 'Sendgrid Mail' }, { key: 'Aliyun DM' }, { key: 'SMTP' }] },
]} />

Choose the one that suits you, and click "Next" to continue.

:::note
We're still working on more connectors! If you don't see the connector you want, follow [Create your connector](/docs/recipes/create-your-connector) to extend or file a [Feature Request](#) on GitHub.

## Configure and test

A full-screen page will guide you through setting things up correctly. Follow the steps below to finish the setup:

1. Go through the README doc on the left, then follow the instructions inside.
2. Fill out the JSON that the connector needs on the right.
3. Click "Next", and in step 2, test if the connector works as expected.
4. Click "Done" to finish.

## Enable connector in sign-in experience

Switch to the "Sign-in Experience" tab by clicking the link in the very left section of the page, then click then "Sign-in Methods" tab.

If you didn't add any other sign-in methods before, "Enable secondary sign-in" should be off. Turn it on, and check "Email sign-in" or "Phone number sign-in" based on which connector you just set up.

Now you should see the text "Sign in with Phone number" or "Sign in with Email" under the big "Sign In" button.

:::tip
Open the demo app again to try out the new sign-in method.
