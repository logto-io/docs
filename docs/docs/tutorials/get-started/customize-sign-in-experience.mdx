# Customize sign-in experience

In the "Get Started" tab, click the "Customize" button on the right, and the browser will redirect to the Sign-in Experience tab.

## Sign-in preview

:::tip Do you know...
You can preview the result in real-time! No matter what you update on the left, the right-side UI will immediately update to synchronize the change.
:::

The customer may use the app under different conditions, including platform, language, and appearance.

Feel free to change them to see the result of your combination.

## Branding

In this area, you can define several main elements of brand expos√©: color, logo, and slogan.

- **Brand color** will affect the primary color of components, e.g., buttons and links.
- **Enable dark mode** controls if the UI has a "dark feeling" when Logto detects related system preference.
- Other options are pretty straightforward, so we skip them here.

## Others

Let's skip "Sign-in methods" for now and move to the "Others" tab.

### Terms of use

An app will likely have a Terms of Use in production, and it's mandatory to accept it before signing in or creating an account.

Toggle on "Enable terms of use" and enter the URL to enforce this process. Logto will load it via an `<iframe>`.

### Language

This section allows you to specify the languages that will be displayed to the end user.

There are two options here that could require your special attention: the first one is **Enable auto-detect** switch and the second one is **select a default language** selector.

In the default configuration, your app will automatically detect the user's locale settings and switch to one of the supported languages in Logto. However, if the detected language is not supported, the default language will be used as a backup.

If you disable the feature, only the default language will be displayed in your app. Since doing so will restrict your access to potential users, it is not generally recommended.

This article is merely an easy starter to help you get a feel for your app language preferences. Go to [Localization](/docs/recipes/localization/README.mdx) for more advanced scenarios and setting recommendations.

## What's next

Yeah, yeah. Signing in without entering the password is the trend. Logto cannot miss it and has built-in support. Choose the one you like to continue:

- [Enable SMS or email passcode sign-in](./enable-passcode-sign-in.mdx)
- [Add a social connector and enable social sign-in](./enable-social-sign-in.mdx)
