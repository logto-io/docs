# Create and integrate the first application

In the "Get Started" tab, click the "Create" button on the right, and the browser will redirect to the Application tab. Then click the "Create Application" button on this page.

## Choose your application type

In the opening modal, choose which type of application you'd like to integrate:

<ApplicationTypesIntro />

We prepared different tutorials for each application type, and it'll be helpful if you choose the type properly.

## Enter application name

Enter the application name, e.g., "Bookstore," and click "Create Application."

## Integrate Logto

Ta-da! You just created your first application in Logto. You'll see a congrats page which includes a detailed integration guide. Follow the guide to see what the experience will be in your application.

:::note
If you skip the guide in Admin Console by accident, you can also pick the guide from the list below or click "Check Help Guide" in the application details page.
