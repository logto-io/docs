## Enable connector in sign-in experience

Switch to the "Sign-in Experience" tab by clicking the link in the very left section of the page, then click the "Sign-in Methods" tab.

If you didn't add any other sign-in methods before, "Enable secondary sign-in" should be off. Turn it on, and check "Social sign-in".

On the table that just showed up, look for the connector you just added in the left column, "Social connectors". Then click the plus icon on the right.

You should see a logo representing the identity provider of the conncetor under the big "Sign In" button.

If you have multiple social connectors in use (in the right column), you can drag and drop them to reorder.

Click "Save changes" to push the changes to go live.
