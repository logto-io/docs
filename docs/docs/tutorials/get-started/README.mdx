## Launch Logto

### Online

Prepend `https://gitpod.io/#` to the Logto repo URL (or <a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/logto-io/logto" target="_blank">click here</a>) and access it. Wait a few moment, you'll see the message like:

<img src={gitpodRunning} alt="GitPod Running" width="600px" />

Press Cmd (or Ctrl) and click the link that starts with `https://3001-...` to continue your Logto journey. Enjoy!

### Local

<TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">

Docker Compose CLI usually comes with [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

:::note
Before the first stable version is available, we use the `prerelease` tag for the Docker image.
:::

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logto-io/logto/HEAD/docker-compose.yml | TAG=prerelease docker compose -p logto -f - up
```

After a successful composition, you will see the message like:

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

1. Prepare a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)@^14.0 instance。
2. Pull the image from ghcr.io:

:::note
Before the first stable version is available, we use the `prerelease` tag for the Docker image.
:::

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/logto-io/logto:prerelease
```

3. Map the container port, e.g., `3001:3001`; and set the following environment variables to the container:

```yml
ALL_YES: 1
NO_INQUIRY: 0
DB_URL_DEFAULT: postgres://username:password@your_postgres_url:5432 # Replace with your Postgres DSN
```

Finally run the container, you will see the message like:

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="script" label="Download script">

**Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `^16.13.0`
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/) `^14.0`

Higher versions usually work but are not guaranteed.

We recommend using a new empty database which is dedicated for Logto, while it's not a hard requirement.

**Download and start**

In your terminal:

```bash
node -e "$(printf "%s" "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logto-io/logto/HEAD/install.js)")"
```

The script will download Logto and create a directory `logto` in the location you ran it. After answering [several simple questions](../../references/core/configuration.md#questions), you will see the message like:

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

```text
App is running at http://localhost:3001
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration (optional)</summary>

Logto uses environment variables for configuration, along with `.env` file support. See [Configuration](../../references/core/configuration.md) for detailed usage and full variable list.

_Check out [Core Service](../../references/core/README.mdx) if you want more advanced controls or programmatic access to Logto._

## Create an admin account

Open the link and you will see a welcome page that briefly introduces Admin Console. Click "Create Account" to create an admin account.

:::note
For now, you cannot create multiple admin accounts via Admin Console, and only the first account will have admin access. If you want to create multiple admin accounts, use the Management API instead.
:::

:::caution
Once you create the first account, the welcome page will be unavailable.
:::

On the create account page, enter your username and password to continue.

## "Get Started" tab

Once you create the admin account, the browser will redirect you to the "Get Started" tab in Admin Console, which shows a few things that Logto can do at a glance.

Our tutorial will follow the order you are seeing. So let's begin!
