# ⚡ Get started

## Launch Logto

### Online

Prepend `https://gitpod.io/#` to the Logto repo URL (or <a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/logto-io/logto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a>) and access it. Wait a few moment, you'll see the message like:

<img src={gitpodRunning} alt="Gitpod is running" width="600px" />

Press Cmd (or Ctrl) and click the link that starts with `https://3001-...` to continue your Logto journey. Enjoy!

### Local

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">

Docker Compose CLI usually comes with [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

:::danger
Do not use our docker compose command for production! Since we currently have a built-in Postgres database bundled together with the Logto app in `docker-compose.yml`,
every time you re-execute the command a new database instance will be created, and any data persisted previously will be lost.
:::

:::note
Before the first stable version is available, we use the `prerelease` tag for the Docker image.
:::

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logto-io/logto/HEAD/docker-compose.yml | TAG=prerelease docker compose -p logto -f - up
```

After a successful composition, you will see the message like:

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

1. Prepare a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)@^14.0 instance。
2. Pull the image:

:::note
Before the first stable version is available, we use the `prerelease` tag for the Docker image.
:::

```bash
# ghcr
docker pull ghcr.io/logto-io/logto:prerelease
# DockerHub
docker pull svhd/logto:prerelease
```

3. Map the container port, e.g., `3001:3001`; and set the following environment variables to the container:

```yml
ALL_YES: 1
NO_INQUIRY: 0
TRUST_PROXY_HEADER: 1 # Set to 1 if you have an HTTPS proxy (e.g. Nginx) in front of Logto
ENDPOINT: http://localhost:3001 # Replace with your Logto endpoint URL if you are using a custom domain
DB_URL_DEFAULT: postgres://username:password@your_postgres_url:5432 # Replace with your Postgres DSN
```

Run the container with all the environment variables above:

```bash
docker run \
--name logto \
-p 3001:3001 \
-e ALL_YES=1 -e NO_INQUIRY=0 \
-e TRUST_PROXY_HEADER=1 \
-e ENDPOINT=https://your-domain-url \
-e DB_URL_DEFAULT=postgres://username:password@172.17.0.1:5432 \
ghcr.io/logto-io/logto:prerelease
```

:::tip

- If you are using Docker Hub, use `svhd/logto:prerelease` instead of `ghcr.io/logto-io/logto:prerelease`.
- Use `172.17.0.1` in `DB_URL_DEFAULT` to refer to the host IP

Finally, you will see the message like:

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="script" label="Download script">

**Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `^16.13.0`
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/) `^14.0`

Higher versions usually work but are not guaranteed.

We recommend using a new empty database which is dedicated for Logto, while it&apos;s not a hard requirement.

**Download and start**

In your terminal:

```bash
node -e "$(printf "%s" "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logto-io/logto/HEAD/install.js)")"
```

The script will download Logto and create a directory `logto` in the location you ran it. After answering [several simple questions](../../references/core/configuration.md#questions), you will see the message like:

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

```text
App is running at http://localhost:3001
App is running at https://your-domain-url
```

Heading to <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:3001/" rel="noopener">http://localhost:3001/</a> to continue your Logto journey. Enjoy!

<summary>Configuration (optional)</summary>

Logto uses environment variables for configuration, along with `.env` file support. See [Configuration](../../references/core/configuration.md) for detailed usage and full variable list.

_Check out [Core Service](../../references/core/README.mdx) if you want more advanced controls or programmatic access to Logto._

### Quick troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>
  My browser cannot load Admin Console (showing error <code>Crypto.subtle is unavailable...</code>)
</summary>

Admin Console uses [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API), which requires [secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts), i.e. HTTPS or HTTP with `localhost`.

If you use HTTP with an IP address or custom domain, then the browser cannot load Admin Console.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  I'm using a custom domain, but my browser cannot load Admin Console (showing error{' '}
  <code>"code": "oidc.invalid_redirect_uri"</code>)
</summary>

If you are using a custom domain rather than `localhost`, you need to set the environment variable `ENDPOINT` to the Logto URL. It is because of the strict requirement of Redirect URI in OIDC. See [Configuration](../../references/core/configuration.md#general) for details.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  I'm using an HTTPS proxy (e.g., Nginx) in front of Logto, but I failed on sign-in (showing error{' '}
  <code>TypeError: Failed to fetch</code>)
</summary>

- First, make sure you have set the node environment variable `TRUST_PROXY_HEADER` to `true`. See [Configuration](../../references/core/configuration.md#using-a-https-proxy) for details.
- Also, you need to set `X-Forward-Proto` header to `https` in your proxy config. See [Trusting TLS offloading proxies](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/blob/main/docs/README.md#trusting-tls-offloading-proxies) for details.

## Create an admin account

Open the link and you will see a welcome page that briefly introduces Admin Console. Click "Create Account" to create an admin account.

:::note
For now, you cannot create multiple admin accounts via Admin Console, and only the first account will have admin access. If you want to create multiple admin accounts, use the Management API instead.
:::

:::caution
Once you create the first account, the welcome page will be unavailable.
:::

On the create account page, enter your username and password to continue.

## "Get Started" tab

Once you create the admin account, the browser will redirect you to the "Get Started" tab in Admin Console, which shows a few things that Logto can do at a glance.

Our tutorial will follow the order you are seeing. So let's begin!
