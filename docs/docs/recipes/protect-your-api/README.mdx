# ⚔️ Protect your API

As an out-of-the-box authorization service, Logto allows you to apply authorization to your backend [API resources](../../references/resources/README.md) for better privacy protection.

## Register the API resources through Logto **Admin Console**

First, you will need to register your backend endpoints in Admin Console. Logto will identify those registered [API resources](../../references/resources/README.md) from an authorization request and grant an audience-restricted `access_token` accordingly.

Go to the **API Resources** section in **Admin Console**. You will notice a build-in resource listed with the API identifier shown as `https://api.logto.io`. This resource indicates all the management APIs of Logto. It guarantees all our APIs are under the protection and restricted to those Logto authorized users only.

Next, click on the **Create API Resource** button and fill out the form fields to register your private API resources:

- A human-readable **API Name** that may better helps you to identify this entity.
- A unique **API Identifier** (a.k.a. [Resource Indicator](../../references/resources/README.md#resource-indicator)) in URI format. It represents the identity of the API resource.

:::caution
The API Identifier is unique and used as the single source of truth of the resource indicator for Logto. **NOT** editable once created. Be careful when you create it.
:::

The new API will show up on the list once created. You may manage or delete it at the API details page by clicking on the entity.

See [API Resource Logto Schema](../../references/resources/README.md#logto-api-resource-schema) for detailed API setting definitions.

:::info
The API Resources data registered in Logto **Admin Console** will be shared across all your applications.

## Parse and Validate the API request's authorization token

The most crucial step, protect your API resources with trustworthy token validation.

As mentioned above, all the authorized requests should carry an [JWT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) format `assess_token` issued by Logto in its Authorization header.

<SecretKey />

<TokenExtract />

<TokenValidation />

## Reference

Logto uses the code-based OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol to make your API request safer. If you are interested in the strategy behind it, refer to OAuth 2.0's [official document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1) for more details.
