# Guide to implementing connectors

After looking at the connector's file structure, let's discuss the implementation and main idea of developing a connector.

## Create a new account on the connector's website

Looking at the connector's website or corresponding console is always the first step in building a connector. You can find out some basic information about the connector provider.

## Search for the developers' documentation which demonstrates the functionality and workflow

We should search for documents with different topics as connectors vary by type: _Social Connector_ is used to guide end-users through authorization sign-in flow, and _Sms/Email Connector_ is designed to call message sender APIs.

:::tip
_Social Connector_ doc keyword(s): authorization flow, OAuth 2.0 (most _Social_ connectors follow this protocol), and obtaining user profile.<br/>
_Sms/Email Connector_ doc keyword: integrate Sms/Email sender API.

## Install connectors

### Unpublished connectors

The easiest way to install a connector locally is to copy the connector folder to the path `logto/packages/core/connectors` and then compile those files.

### Published connectors

If you have already published the connector to npm, you may install the connector with CLI commands

```bash
npm add-connector ${connectorPackageName}
```

at `logto/packages/core` directory.

Congratulations! Your connector should be ready for work after going through this guide. Try it out! :rocket: :rocket: :rocket:
