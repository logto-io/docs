# Guide to implementing connectors

After looking at the connector's file structure, let's discuss the implementation and main idea of developing a connector.

## Create a new account on the connector's website

Looking at the website and its console is always the first step in building a connector. You can find out some basic information about the connector provider.

## Search for the documentation which demonstrates the functionality and workflow

We should search for documents with different topics as connectors vary by type: _Social Connector_ is used to guide end-users through authorization sign-in flow, and _SMS/Email Connector_ is designed to call message sender APIs.

:::tip
_Social Connector_ doc keyword(s): authorization flow, OAuth 2.0 (most _Social_ connectors follow this protocol), and obtaining user profile.<br/>
_SMS/Email Connector_ doc keyword: integrate SMS/Email sender API.
