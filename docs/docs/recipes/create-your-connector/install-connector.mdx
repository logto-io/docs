# Install connectors

In this section, we are going to introduce how to install connectors.

# Install your own connectors

We assume that you have already finished building your own connector. Go through following steps to manually install:

1. Install connector repository's dependencies by typing `pnpm i` at root path of connector folder.
2. Build connector with `pnpm build`.
3. Copy the connector folder you implemented to directory `/packages/core/connectors` of [`logto-io/logto`](https://github.com/logto-io/logto).
4. Restart Logto instance with `pnpm dev` at root directory of `logto-io/logto`, and you can find connectors successfully installed.

You can now test and try your connector to see whether it works as expected.

If you want to add connectors that have already been published to NPM or Logto official connectors, you may check out [Using Logto CLI - Manage connectors](../../tutorials/).
