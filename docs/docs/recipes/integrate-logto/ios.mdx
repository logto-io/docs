# iOS: Integrate Logto Swift SDK

<AppNote type="Native App" />

## Add Logto SDK as a dependency

Use the following URL to add Logto SDK as a dependency in Swift Package Manager.

```bash
https://github.com/logto-io/swift.git
```

Since Xcode 11, you can [directly import a Swift package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) w/o any additional tool.

We do not support **Carthage** and **CocoaPods** at the time due to some technical issues.

<details>
  <summary>Carthage</summary>

Carthage [needs a `xcodeproj` file to build](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/1226#issuecomment-290931385), but `swift package generate-xcodeproj` will report a failure since we are using binary targets
for native social plugins. We will try to find a workaround later.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>CocoaPods</summary>

CocoaPods [does not support local dependency](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3276) and monorepo, thus it's hard to create a `.podspec` for this repo.

</details>

## Init `LogtoClient`

```swift
import Logto
import LogtoClient

let config = try? LogtoConfig(
  endpoint: "<your-logto-endpoint>", // E.g. http://localhost:3001
  appId: "<your-app-id>"
)
let client = LogtoClient(useConfig: config)
```

By default, we store credentials like ID Token and Refresh Token in the Keychain. Thus the user doesn't need to sign in again when he returns.

To turn off this behavior, set `usingPersistStorage` to `false`:

```swift
let config = try? LogtoConfig(
  // ...
  usingPersistStorage: false
)
```

## Sign in

### Configure Redirect URI

<ConfigureRedirectUri figureSrc={redirectUriFigure} redirectUri="io.logto://callback" />

:::info
The Redirect URI in iOS SDK is only for internal use. There's _NO NEED_ to add a [Custom URL Scheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app) until a connector asks.
:::

### Sign in with browser

<SignInNote calling=".signInWithBrowser(redirectUri:)" />

Go back to Xcode, use the following code to implement sign-in:

```swift
do {
  try await client.signInWithBrowser(redirectUri: "io.logto://callback")
  print(client.isAuthenticated) // true
} catch let error as LogtoClientErrors.SignIn {
  // error occured during sign in
}
```

## Sign out

Calling `.signOut()` will clean all the Logto data in Keychain, if it has.

```swift
await client.signOut()
```
