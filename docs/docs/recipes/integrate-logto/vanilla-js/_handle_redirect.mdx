We're almost there! In the last step, we use `http://localhost:3000/callback` as the Redirect URI, and now we need to handle it properly. Insert the code below in your `/callback` route:

```ts
try {
  await logtoClient.handleSignInCallback();
  console.log(await logtoClient.isAuthenticated()); // true
} catch {
  // Handle error
}
```

Now you can test the sign-in flow.
