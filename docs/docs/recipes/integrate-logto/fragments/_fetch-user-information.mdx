Logto SDK helps you fetch the user information from the OIDC [UserInfo Endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo).

<p>
  You can get the user information by calling <code>{props.apiCodeFragment}</code> after signing in.

The user information response will vary based on the scopes used in the `LogtoConfig` while initializing the `LogtoClient`; and the following table lists the relations between user information and scopes:

| Field Name            | Type       | Required Scope | Notes                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| sub                   | `string`   | `openid`       | The `openid` scope is added by default.  |
