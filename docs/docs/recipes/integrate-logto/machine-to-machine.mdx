# Machine to Machine: Auth with Logto

<AppNote type="Machine to Machine" />

## Intro

Machine to Machine (M2M) is a common practice to authenticate if you have an app that needs to directly talks to resources. E.g., an API service that updates users' custom data in Logto, a statistic service that pulls daily orders, etc.

Usually, an M2M app doesn't need user interactions, i.e., it has no UI.

:::info
Logto doesn't support the M2M app to represent a user for now. The `sub` of the Access Token will be the App ID.
:::

## Fetch an Access Token

### Locate the App ID and App Secret

On the application details page, locate the App ID and App Secret.

<img alt="App ID and App Secret" src={AppIdSecretSrc} width="600px" />

#### Accessing Logto Management API

If you want to use this app for accessing [Management API](/docs/references/core/#management-api), remember to turn on "Enable admin access" in the Advanced settings tab.

### Locate the API Resource

In the API Resource tab, find the API identifier that the app needs to access. If you haven't added the API Resource in Logto or don't know what API Resource is, see [API Resource](/docs/references/resources).

<img alt="API identifier" src={AppIdentifierSrc} width="600px" style={{ paddingBottom: '12px' }} />

:::info
Logto Management API is a built-in resource with the fixed identifier `https://api.logto.io`.

### Compose and send the request

Then compose them into a request (**all mandatory**):

- Use Token Endpoint (`https://your.logto.endpoint/oidc/token`) as the request endpoint, and use `POST` as the method.
- Set header `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- Use [Basic authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization#basic_authentication), where username is the App ID, and password is the App Secret.
- Carry the body data:

```json
{
  "grant_type": "client_credentials",
  "resource": "https://shopping.api" // Replace with your API identitfier
}
```

If you are using cURL:

```bash
curl --location \
  --request POST 'http://localhost:3001/oidc/token' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic eW91ci1hcHAtaWQ6eW91ci1hcHAtc2VjcmV0' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
  --data-urlencode 'resource=https://shopping.api'
```

### Token response

A successful response body would be like:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbG...2g", // Use this token for accessing the resource
  "expires_in": 3600, // Token expiration in seconds
  "token_type": "Bearer" // Auth type for your request when using the Access Token
}
```

## Access resource using Access Token

You may notice the token response has a `token_type` field, which it's fixed to `Bearer`. Thus you should put the Access Token in the `Authorization` field of HTTP headers with the Bearer format (`Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`).

For example, if you have requested an Access Token with the resource `https://api.logto.io`, to get all applications in Logto:

```bash
curl --location \
  --request GET 'http://localhost:3001/api/applications' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbG...2g'
```

## Authentication

If you are protecting your own API Resources other than Logto Management API, remember to implement the authentication in your resource. See [Protect your API](/docs/recipes/protect-your-api#validate-the-api-requests-authorization-token) for details.
