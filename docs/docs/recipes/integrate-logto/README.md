# ðŸ”— Integrate Logto in your application

We provide a bunch of SDKs to let you integrate Logto with your clients with ease. If the list doesn't cover your desired platform / framework, please file a feature request or contribute a new SDK.

## Native App

An app that runs in a native environment.

- [iOS](../../../sdk/ios/README.mdx)
- [Android](../../../sdk/android/README.mdx)
- [Flutter](../../../sdk/flutter/README.mdx)

Usually, Native apps need to talk to an API (resource). Please refer to [Protect your API](../protect-your-api/README.mdx) for authenticating in your API.

## Single Page App

An app that runs in a web browser and dynamically updates data in place.

- [Vanilla JS](../../../sdk/vanilla-js/README.mdx)
- [React](../../../sdk/react/README.mdx)
- [Vue](../../../sdk/vue.mdx)

Usually, SPAs need to talk to an API (resource). Please refer to [Protect your API](../protect-your-api/README.mdx) for authenticating in your API.

## Traditional Web

An app that renders and updates pages by the web server alone. E.g., server-side rending.

- [Traditional Web general guide](../../../sdk/traditional.mdx)
- [Next.js](../../../sdk/next-js/README.mdx)
- [Next.js 13 App Router](../../../sdk/next-js-13/README.mdx)
- [Express](../../../sdk/express/README.mdx)
- [Go](../../../sdk/go/README.mdx)

## Machine-to-machine

An app (usually without UI) that directly talks to resources.

- [Machine-to-machine](../../../sdk/machine-to-machine.mdx)
