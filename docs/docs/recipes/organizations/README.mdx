# üè¢ Organizations (Multi-tenancy)

<Availability cloud="comingSoon" oss={{ major: 1, minor: 12 }} />

Organization is particularly effective in business-to-business (B2B) apps. In addtion to individual consumers, business clients can also consist of teams, organizations, or entire companies. Logto introduces the entity of an organization as a foundational element for authentication and authorization in B2B products, for example, SaaS.

Even if your product is not B2B, organization can still be useful for collaboration features, such as sharing resources with other users.

With this fundamental element, you can build the must-have features for multi-tenancy apps, such as:

- A product that can be used by multiple organizations.
- Organization member provision on an invitation or just-in-time basis.
- Access controls that defined by roles assigned to members within an organization.
- Link organizations with Enterprise SSO (single sign-on) experience.

The term "organization" is also used in other forms, such as "workspace", "team", "company", etc. In Logto, we use "organization" as the generic term to represent the concept of multi-tenancy.

## Before we start

Hold on, you may heard of some products use the term "multi-tenancy" to represent the identity isolation: each tenant has its own set of users, permissions, and data.

It may be counterintuitive, but in fact, "multi-tenancy" indicates the contrary: multiple tenants are sharing resources in a single instance. For example, in Notion (a popular collaboration tool):

- You can create and join multiple workspaces with one account, instead of sign up for each workspace with different accounts.
- For each workspace, Notion defines a **same set** of access levels: "Worksapce owner" and "member", while you may expect different access levels for different workspaces.
