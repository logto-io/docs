# Impact on end-user sign-in experience

Currently, there's no impact to the end-user sign-in experience since Logto decouples authentication and authorization. For exmaple, Enterprise SSO (single sign-on) is based on email domains, not organizations.

As the user signs in, they can get the access to all organizations with membership. For detailed information, please refer to Organization RBAC.

We may add advanced features for organizations that change the sign-in experience in the future. Please
