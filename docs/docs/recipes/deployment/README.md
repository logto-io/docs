## Environment Variables

We use a generated preset of environment variables in our demo (`docker-compose.yml`), which you should replace with your own and maintain consistency across multiple Logto instances.

You can set env directly or put a `.env` file inside the Logto project root. If you are testing with Docker, check out the image's generated `.env` in `/etc/logto`.

### Essentials

- `DB_URL` The [Postgres DSN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/libpq-connect.html#id-1.7.3.8.3.6) for Logto database.
- `PORT` The port that Logto listens to. Default `3001`.
- `ENDPOINT` You may specify a URL with your custom domain for production (E.g. `ENDPOINT=https://logto.domain.com`). This will affect the value of the [OIDC issuer identifier](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IssuerIdentifier) and Admin Console Redirect URIs.
- `OIDC_COOKIE_KEYS` The comma-separated string list of the [signing cookie keys](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/blob/main/docs/README.md#cookieskeys). Rotate regularly to keep safety. If you'd like to set multi keys, separate them with comma.
- `OIDC_PRIVATE_KEYS` The comma-separated string list of the private key content for [OIDC JWT signing](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Signing). If you'd like to set this in `.env`, you can leverage [multiline values](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#multiline-values) support. If you'd like to set multi keys, separate them with comma.

**How to set up `OIDC_PRIVATE_KEYS` correctly?**

The value format for `OIDC_PRIVATE_KEYS` is as follows (You can use `\n` to replace newline characters):

```bash
OIDC_PRIVATE_KEYS="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END DSA PRIVATE KEY-----,
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
nOlQ1nS...
...
-----END DSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
```

**I prefer using `.pem` files for my OIDC private keys. What should I do?**

Just leave `OIDC_PRIVATE_KEYS` empty, and set the path of your `.pem` file in the `OIDC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATHS` list. It has a default value of `'./oidc-private-key.pem'`.

You can set multi paths by separating them with comma. E.g. `oidc-private-key1.pem, oidc-private-key-2.pem`.

For more details about environment variables, see [Configuration](../../references/core/configuration.md).

### HTTPS

You may use Node.js to serve HTTPS directly or set up an HTTPS proxy/balancer in front of Node.js. See [Enabling HTTPS](../../references/core/configuration.md#enabling-https) for details.

## How can I upgrade Logto safely?

If we don't mention it in the changelog, you can feel free to upgrade Logto without changing your code or database schema. Our API follows [semver](https://semver.org/).

We'll build a smooth database migration process and demonstrate it in our changelog if a schema change is inevitable. You'll be able to do that with chill.
