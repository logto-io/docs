# Integrate your data with Logto user data

## Identify user

We recommend using `user.id` to identify a user since we guarantee every user has a unique and non-null `id` attribute.

Also, `username` `primary_email` and `primary_phone` are unique properties. But they may be empty. Remember to handle' null' properly if you want to use these properties to identify a user.
