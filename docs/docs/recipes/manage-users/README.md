# 🧑‍🚀 Manage users

You can access your user data using [Admin Console](./admin-console.md) or [Management API](./management-api.md).

With the help of them can do something like these:

- Search users by username, full name, phone number, or email; view their profile, including avatar, social connections, etc.
- Unlink a user's social identity from Facebook, or even delete their account directly in extreme cases.
- Help a user reset the password.

Also, [you don't need a user table](./you-dont-need-a-user-table.md).
