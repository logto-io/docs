# Configure sign-in methods

:::note
Although the term only has "sign-in", to simplify, all these methods also imply the "sign-up method" (if applicable).

## Methods

### Username-with-password

The traditional and default sign-in method. No configuration is required.

### Phone number sign-in

Use a six-digit dynamic passcode which Logto will send to the user's phone number for sign-in. This method needs no permanent password and has become popular nowadays. You need to [configure an SMS connector](../../tutorials/get-started/enable-passcode-sign-in.mdx) before enabling it.

### Email sign-in

Use a six-digit dynamic passcode which Logto will send to the user's email for sign-in. This method needs no permanent password and has become popular nowadays. You need to [configure an email connector](../../tutorials/get-started/enable-passcode-sign-in.mdx) before enabling it.

### Social sign-in

Use a third-party identity such as GitHub or Google for sign-in. You need to [add at least one social connector](../../tutorials/get-started/enable-social-sign-in.mdx) before enabling it.

The social sign-in configuration is a two-column table. The left column represents the connectors you've added, while the right column holds the connectors that sign-in experience is using.

- To use a new connector in sign-in experience, click the "+" button.
- To remove a connector from sign-in experience, click the "-" button.
- To change the order of a connector that is in use, just drag and drop.

:::note
It will show trailing platform icons for [non-universal connectors](../../references/connectors/README.mdx#platform) (e.g., WeChat).

## Sign-in method types

We have two types of sign-in methods: Primary and secondary.

As the term suggests:

- _Primary sign-in method_ is the one you want to highlight. Everything is large and outstanding for this method.
- _Secondary sign-in methods_ sit on the secondary visual area with smaller components to hold more methods on the home screen.

## Primary sign-in method

According to your business and the status quo, you may want to use different sign-in methods as the primary. E.g.:

- An internal app that only needs username-with-password sign-in.
- A social app that uses social sign-in to make a frictionless user journey.

Use the dropdown to change the primary sign-in method and see what happens in the preview.

## Secondary sign-in methods

Logto supports enabling multiple sign-in methods in the secondary area to provide various sign-in options for your users or support a smooth sign-in method transition.

Toggle on _Enable secondary sign-in_ to configure what should enable as the secondary sign-in method.

:::note
You cannot set a method as primary and secondary at the same time.
:::

:::danger
Be careful about disabling sign-in methods in production! Your users will lose the ability to sign in again if they didn't use one of the methods left.
