## Terms of use

If enabled, it's mandatory to accept it before the user signs in or creates an account.

Enter the URL for terms of use, and Logto will load it via an `<iframe>` when needed.

## Language

### Auto mode

By default, Logto uses _Auto_ mode to detect the environment and change language dynamically. If Logto finds no proper language phrase-set, it will fall back to English.

You can change the fallback language by clicking the dropdown.

### Fixed mode

If you want to fix the language to display, use _Fixed_ mode instead. In this mode, no matter what language the environment prefers, it'll show the language you designate.
