# 🎨 Customize sign-in experience

Sign-in experience is the core flow for end-users, including sign-in and sign-up. It provides a unified experience across apps, devices, and platforms.

:::note
In most cases, a single sign-in experience is good enough. But you may need some special customizations based on region or app, and we're working on this feature. Stay tuned.
:::

Logto covers the tedious part, so you can have fun with customization to define the unique experience for your users.

In Admin Console, click the "Sign-in Experience" tab on the left, and you'll see a two-column page.

The left column is the customization section with three tabs: [Branding](./configure-branding.mdx), [Sign-in Methods](./configure-sign-in-methods.mdx), and [Others](./tou-and-language.mdx).

The right column is a live preview that will immediately update to synchronize the change when you update things on the left.

:::tip Use preview to save your time

- Click the tab "Mobile" or "Web" to see what the homepage looks like on different platforms.
- Change the language or theme dropdown to see the appearance under different system preferences.
