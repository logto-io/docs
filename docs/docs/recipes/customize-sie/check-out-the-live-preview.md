# Check out the live preview

You can use the live preview feature for convenient testing of your sign-in experience configurations.

Navigating to "Sign-in experience" and clicking the "Live preview" button in the top right corner will open a new browser tab with a fully functional demo of Logto's capabilities. This demo showcases our experience design approach for sign-in and sign-up flows. It is highly customizable and can be seamlessly integrated into your application.

:::note
Please note, in this preview, you should create an account first to test the experience.
:::

If you try to sign in with the user account you created and the process is successful with no issues, you will be redirected to a success page that displays your identifiers and ID.
