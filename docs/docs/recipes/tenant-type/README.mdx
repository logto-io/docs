# üè∑Ô∏è Tenant type

<CloudOnlyNotification feature="tenant type" />

## Type of tenants

There are two types of tenants in Logto Cloud.

### Development

The dev environment is mainly used for testing and should not be used in the production environment. It has all the premium and paid features of the Pro plan, it's free forever to test but has some [limitations](#limitation), and no subscription is required.

### Production

Production is where end-users access the live software and might need a paid subscription. You can subscribe to the free, hobby, or pro plan to access a production tenant.

:::note
Please be aware that you can only specify your tenant types during creation; it is not possible to modify the tenant type once it has been created.
:::

With the new type of tenant differentiation, you can better manage your projects across different environments for efficiency and, at the same time, enjoy the full value of Logto.

## Legacy migration

For existing users who use the ‚Äúenvironment tag‚Äù feature, we will be phasing out these tags and introducing a more robust system for differentiating between tenants.

Moving forward, we will have two distinct tenant types: **Development** and **Production**. The development tenant offers enhanced features for testing and exploring different values of Logto. However, please note that there may be some restrictions on this type of tenant (Please refer to the following section).

To ensure a seamless transition and uninterrupted functionality, all early-created tenants will be migrated to the Production tenant type along with your previous subscription.

## Development tenant privilege and limitation

### Privilege

1. The development tenant includes all Pro plan features, no paywall, and no feature quota limitation.
2. The development tenant doesn‚Äôt have a bill or billing history section. It offers unlimited access and free usage of all features.

### Limitation

- When signing in, you will see a banner indicating that this sign-in experience is specifically meant for development purposes.
