# 🔌 Connectors

## Introduction

### What is a connector?

_Connectors_ play a critical role in Logto. With their help, Logto enables end-users to use passwordless registration or sign-in and the capabilities of signing in with social accounts. With the increasing popularity of websites and applications, passwordless and social sign-ins allow users to avoid managing numerous accounts and passwords.

:hushed: Sounds fascinating, uh? See "[Configure connectors](../../recipes/configure-connectors/README.md)" if you want to set up an existing connector. If you can not find the connector you want to set up, you may develop those connectors by following the guides in "[Create your connector](../../recipes/create-your-connector/README.md)".

## Compositions

There are lots of properties in connector data.

To make the data loading and updating more efficient, we store part of connector data which will be modified frequently to DB and the rest of that locally.

<ConnectorStorageIntro />

## Connector's local storage: _ConnectorMetadata_

### id

_id_ is an _unique_ string-typed key to identify a connector in Logto.

It's assigned by the developers of each connector and will be uploaded to DB.

### target

_target_ is a lowercase string to distinguish the social identities source of the social connector.

For example, both _WeChat web connector_ and _WeChat native connector_'s _target_ are `wechat`. _Aliyun direct mail connector_'s _target_ is `aliyun-dm` and _Aliyun SMS connector_'s _target_ is `aliyun-sms`.

### type

_type_ is the property that record the type of the connector.

We define the connectors into three different types, based on their functionalities:

<ConnectorTypeIntro />

### platform

_platform_ is used to identify which platform the connector is built for.

_platform_ should be either `null` or one of the following string-typed values:

<ConnectorPlatformIntro />

:::note
_platform_ of _Email Connectors_ and _SMS Connectors_ should always be `null`.<br/>
ONLY _Social Connectors_ can have non-NULL _platform_ values.
:::

### name

_name_ is an object whose keys are i18n country codes and values are connectors' display name.

### description

_description_ is also an object whose keys are i18n country codes and values are brief connector descriptions.

:::note
To support i18n display at the client-side, we store the _name_ (as well as _description_) props as a map, which uses country codes as its' key, name (or description) in local characters as the value.
:::

### logo

_logo_ is an URL or relative path of connector's logo.

### logoDark

_logoDark_ is a _nullable_ URL or relative path of connector's dark mode logo.

:::note
_logo_ is always required, and _logoDark_ is optional.

We display _logo_ in light mode and _logoDark_ in dark mode if it exists. Otherwise will fall back to show _logo_ in dark mode.
:::

### readme

_readme_ is a relative path of the connector's README markdown file whose contexts will show up in "Admin Console" during connectors' set-up.

### configTemplate

_configTemplate_ is a relative path of the connector's configuration example.

## Connector's remote storage: _Connector DB_

### id

_id_ is an _unique_ string-typed key to identify connector in DB and is the ONLY bridge to align _Connector DB_ and _ConnectorMetadata_.

### enabled

_enabled_ is a boolean variable whose default value is `false`. It is the switch to control whether a connector is in use or not.

Configured and working connectors can be shut down by simply switching _enabled_ from `true` to `false`.

### config

_config_ could be an arbitrary non-empty object.

It is where a connector store its configuration. Each connector have different properties in _config_ and it obligated to be valid (connectors have different standard for "valid".) before being saved to DB. ONLY those _config_ passed validity check can be updated to DB, or there would throw an error.

Developers are required to implement a _config_ guard when developing their own connectors, see "[Create your connector](../../recipes/create-your-connector/README.md)" for more details.

Want to have a glance at _config_ samples? Go to "[Configure connectors](../../recipes/configure-connectors/README.md)" or each connector's settings page.

:::note
In current Logto version (v1.0), only one _SMS/Email_ connector can be "enabled" at the same time, which means _enabled_ is set to be `true`, all other connectors with same type are automatically set _enabled_ to be `false`.

The rule, unique working SMS or Email connector, is not applicable to _Social_ connectors.<br/>
In other words, you can add multiple _Social_ connectors.

### createdAt

_createdAt_ is an auto-generated timestamp string to track the time when a connector is created in DB.
