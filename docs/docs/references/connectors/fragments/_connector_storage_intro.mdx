- _Local storage_, also known as [_ConnectorMetadata_](../README.mdx#connectors-remote-storage-connector-db), is an object containing fixed properties such as logo, connector type, and so on. (:face_with_monocle: Having trouble understanding these properties? No worry, a detailed explanation comes later!)
- _Remote storage_ is stored in DB for the sake of relatively frequent changes on those data.
