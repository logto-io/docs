# Logto SDK Convention

This section demonstrates functionalities provided by Logto SDK and the convention between various languages and platforms.

## Repo Design Strategy

<RepoDesignStrategies />

## Core

### Basic Conventions

- The core should contain platform-independent functions only.
- The core should be named as `{$language}` and under the repository root directory. E.g., `logto/js/js`, `logto/kotlin/kotlin`.
- The core package should be named as `{$language}` under Logto scope. E.g., `@logto/js`, `io.logto.sdk:kotlin`.

### Basic Requirements

Any core SDK should contain:

- Types
- Utility functions
- Core functions

#### Types

<CoreTypes />

#### Utility Functions

<CoreUtilityFunctions />

#### Core Functions

<CoreFunctions />

## Platform SDK

Platform SDK provides a standard way to integrate the client with Logto service in the specific platform and accelerates the integration process.

- Platform SDK encapsulates [the core](#core) with platform-specific implementation.
- Platform SDK should provide basic types that make SDK easier to use.
- Platform SDK should be exported as a class named `LogtoClient`.
