# Platform SDK

Platform SDK provides a standard way to integrate the client with Logto service in the specific platform and accelerates the integration process.

- Platform SDK encapsulates [the core](./core-sdk-convention.mdx) with platform-specific implementation.
- Platform SDK should provide basic types that make SDK easier to use.
- Platform SDK should be exported as a class named `LogtoClient`.
