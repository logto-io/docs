# Design Strategy

- Every programming language should have an isolated git repository named `${language}`.
- Each programming language repository should be a mono repo.
- Both SDKs and their associated sample projects should be placed under this repository.

Examples:

<details>
  <summary>JS</summary>

- js (core)
- react
- react-sample

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Kotlin</summary>

- kotlin (core)
- android
- android-sample

</details>
