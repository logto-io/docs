# Rotate signing keys

<Availability cloud oss={{ major: 1, minor: 8 }} />

Logto OIDC signing keys, as known as “OIDC private keys” and “OIDC cookie keys”, are the signing keys used to encrypt JWT tokens (access tokens and ID tokens) and browser cookies in Logto sign-in sessions.

Rotate your signing keys regularly can reduce the risks of potential key compromise. Logto recommends you to rotate your signing keys at least once a year.

## Rotate OIDC private signing keys

Use the CLI command below to generate a new OIDC private signing key. The new key will be automatically utilized after reboot.

Available options:

```
--type    (Optional) The signing key algorithm for your JWT tokens.
          Values are "rsa" or "ec". Defaults to "ec".
```

## What about the previous keys?

Logto key rotation commands will not delete your previous signing keys, and they will be kept in the database unless you manually delete them.

Also, be cautious when deleting your previous keys, as it may cause unexpected issues. It is recommended to keep both the new key and the previous key for a period of time (e.g. 2 weeks), until you are confident that all your users have migrated to the new key.
