# Database alteration

When developing new features, or refactoring existing ones, sometimes it is unavoidable to change database schemas.

Things may sound scary, as a user, usually you need to:

- Double check the difference between two or more versions
- Alter database in a safe and backward-compatible way
- Get prepared for potential failure, say have a rollback script
- Gradually replace running Logto instances to the new verion

**Hey, we are also developers, and we know it feels unhappy to do all these risky but mandatory stuff.** So why don't we give them to someone that won't make mistake, like a CLI?

From now on, your upgrade process will be:

- Run `logto db alt deploy` from anywhere that can access to the database
- Gradually replace running Logto instances to the new verion

Let's get started!

## Determine the version to deploy

If you have Logto CLI installed globally, it is **highly recommended** to upgrade the CLI to the latest version before deploying to get full available database alterations. Then run the command:

<Tabs groupId="cmd">

  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```bash
logto db alteration deploy
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx">

```bash
npx @logto/cli db alteration deploy
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If your database is up-to-date, you'll see the message below:

```bash
[info] Found 0 alteration to deploy
```

If you have undeployed alterations, the CLI will ask you to choose the desired version:

```bash
? Choose the alteration target version (Use arrow keys)
> 1.2.0
  1.0.0
```

Theoretically, the version to deploy should match the version of your Logto instance. In the meantime, you can use the command with a target version:

<Tabs groupId="cmd">

  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```bash
logto db alteration deploy 1.2.0
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx">

```bash
npx @logto/cli db alteration deploy 1.2.0
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

It is helpful when you'd like to do the alteration in a non-TTY pipeline, just remember to pass the database URL using `--db-url`. See [🚀 Deployment](/docs/recipes/deployment) for setting up a alteration job in your cluster.

:::info
For each alteration script, the Logto CLI will run the whole script in a transaction. So if a deployment is failed, you can easily continue with the same command after the issue fixed.
:::

## Rollback alterations

Our alteration scripts also come with a `down` script which can rollback the changes. To rollback the database status to a specific version, replace `1.0.0` with your target version and run the command below:

<Tabs groupId="cmd">

  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```bash
logto db alteration rollback 1.0.0
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx">

```bash
npx @logto/cli db alteration rollback 1.0.0
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note
You can find all alteration scripts [in this directory](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/tree/master/packages/schemas/alterations).

## For contributors

The master branch of Logto repository may contain unpublished alteration scripts. You may need to manually deploy "next" alterations by running:

<Tabs groupId="cmd">

  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```bash
logto db alteration deploy next
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx">

```bash
npx @logto/cli db alteration deploy next
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you are developing a feature that requires database alterations, rather than updating the database schema, you also need to provide a script in the following foramt:

```bash
next-[timestamp]-what-to-do.ts
```
