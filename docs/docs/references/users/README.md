# üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Users

The _users_ are the main entities of the identity service.
We will describe the user-related concepts and details in the following.

## Profile

Each user has a profile containing the user information.

A user profile consists of the following types of data:

- [basic_data](#basic_data) contains basic info in pre-defined attributes, such as user id, username, email, phone number, and when the user last signed in.
- [custom_data](#custom_data) contains additional info in customizable attributes, such as user-preferred color and language.
- [identities](#identities) contains the user info retrieved from social sign-in (i.e., sign-in with a social connector), such as Facebook, GitHub, and WeChat.

### All attributes

The following attributes (except _password_encrypted_ and _password_encryption_method_) are visible on the user profile,
which means you can query them using Management API.

:::note

- **Unique**: Ensures the [uniqueness](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-UNIQUE-CONSTRAINTS) of the values entered into an attribute of a database table.

#### Sample user profiles

A user that signed in with Facebook:

```json
{
  "id": "iHXPuSb9eMzt",
  "username": null,
  "primaryEmail": null,
  "primaryPhone": null,
  "name": "John Joe",
  "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png",
  "roleNames": ["admin"],
  "customData": {
    "preferences": {
      "language": "en",
      "color": "#f236c9"
    }
  },
  "identities": {
    "facebook": {
      "userId": "106077000000000",
      "details": {
        "id": "106077000000000",
        "name": "John Joe",
        "email": "johnjoe@logto.io",
        "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
      }
    }
  },
  "lastSignInAt": 1655799453171,
  "applicationId": "admin_console"
}
```

You can query the user profile using
[Admin Console](../../../docs/recipes/manage-users/using-admin-console#view-and-update-user-profile) or
[Management API](../../../docs/recipes/manage-users/using-management-api),
such as <a href="/api/#tag/Users/paths/~1api~1users~1:userId/get" target="_blank">`GET /api/users/:userId`</a>.

### basic_data

#### user_id

_user_id_ is a unique auto-generated key to identify the user in Logto.

#### username

_username_ is used for sign-in with _username_ and password.

Its value is from the username that the user first registered with.
It may be `null`.
Its non-null value should be no longer than 128 characters, only contain letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`), and NOT start with a number.

#### primary_email

_primary_email_ is the user's email address, used for sign-in with the email and passcode.

Its value is usually from the email address that the user first registered with.
It may be `null`.
Its max length is 128.

#### primary_phone

_primary_phone_ is the user's phone number, used for sign-in with the phone number and passcode from SMS.

Its value is usually from the phone number that the user first registered with.
It may be `null`.
Its non-null value should contain numbers prefixed with the
[country calling code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes) (excluding the plus sign `+`).

#### name

_name_ is the user's full name.
Its max length is 128.

#### avatar

_avatar_ is the URL pointing to the user's avatar image.
Its max length is 2048.

If the user registers with a social connector like Facebook and WeChat, its value may be retrieved from the social user info.

#### role_names

_roles_names_ represent the roles granted to the user in Logto.

:::info

For example, only the users whose _roles_names_ contain `admin`, i.e., the admin users, have permission to use "Admin Console" and "Management API" in Logto.

:::

You cannot update the user's _role_names_ using [Admin Console](../../../docs/recipes/manage-users/using-admin-console#view-and-update-user-profile) for now.

#### application_id

The value of [_application_id_](../applications/#application-id) is from the application the user first signed in to.
It may be `null`.

#### last_signed_in_at

_last_signed_in_at_ is the timestamp with the timezone when the user signed in last time.

#### password_encrypted

_password_encrypted_ is used to store the user's encrypted password.

Its value is from the password that the user first registered with.
It may be `null`.
If its value is non-null, its original content before encryption should be at least six characters.

#### password_encryption_method

_password_encryption_method_ is used to encrypt the user's password.
Its value is initialized when the user registers with the username and password.
It may be `null`.

Logto uses [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)'s implementation [node-argon2](https://github.com/ranisalt/node-argon2) as the encryption method by default; see the reference for details if you're interested.

Sample a _password_encrypted_ and _password_encryption_method_ from a user whose password is `123456`:

```json
{
  "password_encryption_method": "Argon2i",
  "password_encrypted": "$argon2i$v=19$m=4096,t=10,p=1$aZzrqpSX45DOo+9uEW6XVw$O4MdirF0mtuWWWz68eyNAt2u1FzzV3m3g00oIxmEr0U"
}
```

### custom_data

For example, you can use _custom_data_ to do the following things:

- Record whether or not specific actions have been done by the user, such as having seen the welcome page.
- Store application-specific data in the user profile, such as the user's preferred language and appearance per application.

Sample _custom_data_ from an admin user in Logto:

```json
{
  "adminConsolePreferences": {
    "language": "en",
    "appearanceMode": "system",
    "experienceNoticeConfirmed": true
  }
}
```

Each user's _custom_data_ is stored in an individual JSON object.

:::caution DO NOT put sensitive data in _custom_data_

You may fetch a user profile containing _custom_data_ using Management API and send it to the frontend apps or external backend services.
Therefore, putting the sensitive information in _custom_data_ may cause data leaks.

If you still want to put the sensitive information in _custom_data_, we recommend encrypting it first.
Only encrypt/decrypt it in a trusted party like your backend services, and avoid doing it in the frontend apps.
These will minimize the loss if your users' _custom_data_ is leaked by mistake.

:::

You can update the user's _custom_data_ using
[Admin Console](../../../docs/recipes/manage-users/using-admin-console#view-and-update-user-profile) or
[Management API](../../../docs/recipes/manage-users/using-management-api),
such as <a href="/api/#tag/Users/paths/~1api~1users~1:userId/patch" target="_blank">`PATCH /api/users/:userId`</a>.

:::caution Update carefully

Updating a user's _custom_data_ will overwrite (not merge) its original content as a whole in the storage.

:::

### identities

_identities_ contains the user info retrieved from social sign-in
(i.e., sign-in with a social connector).

The user info varies by provider, and it typically includes the following:

- [Target](../../../docs/references/connectors/#target) of this provider, such as lowercase "facebook", "google", or "wechat"
- User's unique identifier for this provider
- User's name
- User's verified email
- User's avatar

The user's account may be linked to multiple social identity providers via social sign-in, such as Facebook, Google, and WeChat;
the related user info retrieved from these providers will be stored in the _identities_ object.

Sample _identities_ from a user:

```json
{
  "facebook": {
    "userId": "5110888888888888",
    "details": {
      "id": "5110888888888888",
      "name": "John Joe",
      "email": "johnjoe@logto.io",
      "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
    }
  },
  "wechat": {
    "userId": "O8sU-6JWMMNZzuXo6-xaEjouyQZ8",
    "details": {
      "id": "O8sU-6JWMMNZzuXo6-xaEjouyQZ8",
      "name": "John Joe",
      "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
    }
  }
}
```

:::info

The _identities_ can NOT be updated using Admin Console or Management API.

Every time the user signs in with a social connector,
their _identities_ will be automatically imported or updated from the identity provider.
