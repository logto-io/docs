# üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Users

The _users_ are the main entities of the identity service.
We will describe the user-related concepts and details in the following.

## Profile

Each user has a profile containing the user information.

A user profile consists of the following types of data:

- [**Basic data**](#basic-data): contains basic info in pre-defined attributes, such as user id, username, email, phone number, and when the user last signed in.
- [**Custom data**](#custom-data): contains additional info in customizable attributes, such as user-preferred color and language.
- [**Identities**](#identities): contains the user info retrieved from social sign-in (i.e., sign-in with a social connector), such as Facebook, GitHub, and WeChat.

### All attributes

The following attributes (except `password_encrypted` and `password_encryption_method`) are visible on the user profile,
which means you can query them using Management API.

:::note

- **Unique**: Ensures the [uniqueness](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-UNIQUE-CONSTRAINTS) of the values entered into an attribute of a database table.
- **Required**: Ensures that the values entered an attribute of a database table can NOT be `NULL`.

#### Sample user profiles

A user that signed in with Facebook:

```json
{
  "id": "iHXPuSb9eMzt",
  "username": null,
  "primaryEmail": null,
  "primaryPhone": null,
  "name": "John Joe",
  "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png",
  "roleNames": ["admin"],
  "customData": {
    "preferences": {
      "language": "en",
      "color": "#f236c9"
    }
  },
  "identities": {
    "facebook": {
      "userId": "106077000000000",
      "details": {
        "id": "106077000000000",
        "name": "John Joe",
        "email": "johnjoe@logto.io",
        "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
      }
    }
  },
  "lastSignInAt": 1655799453171,
  "applicationId": "admin_console"
}
```

You can query the user profile using
[Admin Console](../../../docs/recipes/manage-users/using-admin-console#view-and-update-user-profile) or
[Management API](../../../docs/recipes/manage-users/using-management-api),
such as <a href="/api/#tag/Users/paths/~1api~1users~1:userId/get" target="_blank">`GET /api/users/:userId`</a>.

### basic data

_basic data_ contains the basic user info in pre-defined attributes.

#### user id

_user id_ is a unique auto-generated key to identify the user in Logto.

#### username

_username_ is used for sign-in with _username_ and password.

When the user has not registered with their username, their _username_ may be empty.
When the _username_ is non-empty, it should be at most 128 characters, only contain letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`), and NOT start with a number.

#### primary email

_primary email_ is the user's email address, used for sign-in with the email and passcode.

When the user has not registered with their email, their _primary email_ may be empty.
When the _primary email_ is non-empty, it should be at most 128 characters.

#### primary phone

_primary phone_ is the user's phone number, used for sign-in with the phone number and passcode from SMS.

When the user has not registered with their phone number, their _primary phone_ may be empty.
When the _primary phone_ is non-empty, it should contain numbers prefixed with the
[country calling code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes) (excluding the plus sign `+`).

#### name

_name_ is the user's full name.
Its max length is 128.

#### avatar

_avatar_ is the URL pointing to the user's avatar image.

If the user registers with a social connector like Facebook and WeChat, their _avatar_ may be retrieved from the social user info.
Its max length is 2048.

#### role names

_roles names_ represent the roles granted to the user in Logto.

A _role_ is a group of permissions that you can grant to users.
Using roles makes it easier to grant, revoke, and adjust permissions than assigning permissions to users individually.

You cannot update the user's _role names_ using Admin Console for now. Stay tuned.

:::info

For example, only the users whose roles names contain `admin`, i.e., the admin users, have permission to use Admin Console and Management API in Logto.

:::

#### application id

_application id_ is the [application ID](../applications/#application-id) (i.e., [client id](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/)) that the user first registered.

#### last signed in at

_last signed in at_ is the timestamp with the timezone when the user signed in last time.

#### password encrypted

_password encrypted_ is used to store the user's encrypted password.

When the user has not registered with their username and password, their _password encrypted_ may be empty.
The password before encryption should be at least six characters.

#### password encryption method

_password encryption method_ is used to encrypt the user's password.
When the user has not registered with their username and password, their _password encryption method_ may be empty.

Logto uses [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)'s implementation [node-argon2](https://github.com/ranisalt/node-argon2) as the encryption method by default; see the reference for details if you're interested.

Sample a `password_encrypted` and `password_encryption_method` from a user whose password is "123456":

```json
{
  "password_encryption_method": "Argon2i",
  "password_encrypted": "$argon2i$v=19$m=4096,t=10,p=1$aZzrqpSX45DOo+9uEW6XVw$O4MdirF0mtuWWWz68eyNAt2u1FzzV3m3g00oIxmEr0U"
}
```

### custom data

_custom data_ contains additional info in customizable attributes.
For example, you can use _custom data_ to do the following things:

- Record whether or not specific actions have been done by the user, such as having seen the welcome page.
- Store application-specific data in the user profile, such as the user's preferred language and appearance per application.

Sample _custom data_ from an admin user in Logto:

```json
{
  "adminConsolePreferences": {
    "language": "en",
    "appearanceMode": "system",
    "experienceNoticeConfirmed": true
  }
}
```

Each user's _custom data_ is stored in an individual JSON object.

:::caution Put sensitive data in _custom data_

You may fetch a user profile as a whole containing _custom data_ using Management API and send it to the frontend apps or external backend services.
Therefore, putting the sensitive information in _custom data_ may cause data leaks.

If you still want to put the sensitive information in _custom data_, we recommend encrypting it first.
Only encrypt/decrypt it in a trusted party like your backend services, and avoid doing it in the frontend apps.
These will minimize the damage if your users' _custom data_ is leaked by mistake.

:::

You can update the user's _custom data_ using
[Admin Console](../../../docs/recipes/manage-users/using-admin-console#view-and-update-user-profile) or
[Management API](../../../docs/recipes/manage-users/using-management-api),
such as <a href="/api/#tag/Users/paths/~1api~1users~1:userId/patch" target="_blank">`PATCH /api/users/:userId`</a>.

:::caution Update carefully

Updating a user's _custom data_ will overwrite (not merge) its original content as a whole in the storage.

:::

### identities

_identities_ contains the user info retrieved from social sign-in
(i.e., sign-in with a social connector).

The user info varies by provider, and it typically includes the following:

- [Target](#TODO-link-to-connector-reference) of this provider, such as lowercase "facebook", "google", or "wechat"
- User's unique identifier for this provider
- User's name
- User's verified email
- User's avatar

The user's account may be linked to multiple social identity providers via social sign-in, such as Facebook, Google, and WeChat;
the related user info retrieved from these providers will be stored in the _identities_ object.

Sample _identities_ from a user:

```json
{
  "facebook": {
    "userId": "5110888888888888",
    "details": {
      "id": "5110888888888888",
      "name": "John Joe",
      "email": "johnjoe@logto.io",
      "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
    }
  },
  "wechat": {
    "userId": "O8sU-6JWMMNZzuXo6-xaEjouyQZ8",
    "details": {
      "id": "O8sU-6JWMMNZzuXo6-xaEjouyQZ8",
      "name": "John Joe",
      "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
    }
  }
}
```

:::info

The _identities_ can NOT be updated using Admin Console or Management API.

Every time the user signs in with a social connector,
their _identities_ will be automatically imported or updated from the identity provider.
