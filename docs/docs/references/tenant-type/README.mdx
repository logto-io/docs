## Type of tenants

There are two types of tenants in Logto Cloud.

### Development

The development tenant (dev tenant) is primarily intended for testing purposes and should not be utilized in a production environment. These tenants allow access to premium and paid features available in paid plans, free of charge and without requiring a subscription. However, there are certain [limitations](#limitations-of-development-tenants) that apply to development tenants.

### Production

The production teant is where end-users access the live app and you might need a paid subscription. You can subscribe to the free, or pro plan to create a production tenant.

:::note
Please be aware that you can only specify your tenant types during creation; it is not possible to modify the tenant type once it has been created.
:::

With this tenant differentiation, you can better manage your projects across different environments for efficiency and, at the same time, enjoy the full value of Logto.

## Limitations of development tenants

While you can use paid features for free in development tenants, there are a few limitations:

- A banner appears during the sign-in experience, indicating that the tenant is in development mode.
- Development tenants may have quota limits on specific features. These limits are explained on the feature details page, if applicable.
- Logto may update the development tenant's quota limits, and we will try our best to notify you in advance.
