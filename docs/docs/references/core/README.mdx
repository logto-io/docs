# 🧱 Core Service

## Introduction

_Core Service_ is a monolith service for critical Logto duties. The source code is in [`/packages/core`](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/tree/master/packages/core).

:::note
_Core Service_ and _SDK core_ are two separate concepts. See [SDK Convention](../sdk-convention/README.md) for the differences.
:::

To simplify, we divide Core Service into four major modules:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>Mount Path</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>OIDC Provider</td>
      <td>
        An{' '}
        <a
          href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
        >
          OpenID Provider
        </a>
        .
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>/oidc</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Management API</td>
      <td>APIs for managing Logto. The admin role is required.</td>
      <td>
        <code>/api</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Frontend proxies</td>
      <td>HTTP proxies or static file serving for frontend projects.</td>
      <td>
        See <a href="#frontend-proxies">Frontend proxies</a> for details.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Backend APIs, including OIDC, are built within the `core` package, while frontend proxies depend on the corresponding sibling packages in the Logto monorepo.

## OIDC Provider

Logto uses the amazing certified [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) implementation [`node-oidc-provider`](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider) under the hood. The provider is mounted at `/oidc`, and you can check relative configurations and files in [`packages/core/src/oidc`](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/tree/master/packages/core/src/oidc).

:::info
If you want to directly call OIDC APIs, remember to set header `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

### Enabled OpenID features

- [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)
- [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)
- [OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html)
- [OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7009.html)
- [OAuth 2.0 Resource Indicators](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html)

## Management API

_Management API_ is a set of APIs that manage and update Logto data. Only users with the `admin` role have access to them.

It's mounted at `/api`. Head to [API Reference](/api) to see the details in your browser, or use `GET /api/swagger.json` for a Swagger result in JSON.

To access the API programmatically, see [🚝 Interact with Management API](../../recipes/interact-with-management-api/README.md).

### Authentication

Admin Console heavily depends on these APIs, while you can also call them manually.

<BasicTokenRequirements>
  Its <code>scope</code> includes <code>&quot;all&quot;</code>.
</BasicTokenRequirements>

<BearerAuth />

## User API

We provide a standard OIDC [Userinfo Endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo) mounted at `/oidc/me`.

### Authentication

<BasicTokenRequirements />

<BearerAuth />

### About refresh token reuse interval

You may notice Refresh Token has a rotation delay (3s). This delay helps avoid concurrency issues when exchanging the rotating refresh token multiple times within a given timeframe.

During the leeway window (in seconds), the consumed refresh token will still be considered as valid.

This is useful for distributed apps and serverless apps like Next.js, in which there is no shared memory.

## Frontend proxies

A _frontend proxy_ is a middleware function that serves a frontend project in an environment-related way:

- If it's development, it proxies HTTP requests to the frontend dev server.
- If it's production, it serves static frontend files directly.

Logto has three frontend proxies:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>Frontend Package</td>
      <td>Mount Path</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Admin Console proxy</td>
      <td>
        <code>/packages/console</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>/console</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Demo app proxy</td>
      <td>
        <code>/packages/demo-app</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>/demo-app</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>UI (sign-in experience) proxy</td>
      <td>
        <code>/packages/ui</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>/</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

:::note
You may notice that the UI proxy uses the root path. Unlike other proxies, the UI proxy is a fallback proxy which means it only takes effect when no other proxy is matched.
