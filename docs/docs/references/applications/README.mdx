## Introduction

Each real-world application that requires user authentication using Logto needs to be registered as an application in Logto.

## Application ID

_Application ID_ is a unique auto-generated identifier to identify your application with the Logto application.

## Application Types

We provide three application types to help developers integrate their applications with Logto:

- **Native App** is an app that runs in a native environment. E.g., iOS app, Android app.
- **Single Page App** is an app that runs in a web browser, which updates the page with the new data from the server without loading entire new pages. E.g., React DOM app, Vue app.
- **Traditional Web App** is an app that renders and updates pages by the web server alone. E.g., JSP, PHP.
