# üìÅ API Resource

## Introduction

### What is an API resource?

API resources, a.k.a. [Resource Indicators](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html), indicate the target services or resources to be requested. Usually in a URI format variable, representing the resource's identity.

### Why is API resource needed?

Logto, as an authorization server, is designed to serve a large number of diverse resources and APIs. By indicating which API resource an end-user intends to request, Logto will be able to determine the type and content of authorization tokens to be issued, how tokens are encrypted, and apply audience restrictions accordingly.

A guarded request with an authorization token provided will help you protect your private resources from being accessed and attacked by anonymous identities.

## Definitions

### Resource Indicator

- A resource value indicates the target service or resource to which access is being requested.
- Its value **MUST** be an absolute URI.
- The URI **MUST NOT** include a fragment component.
- It **SHOULD NOT** include a query component.
- You **SHOULD** provide the most specific URI it can for the complete API or set of resources it intends to access.

In practice, a client may know a base URI for the application or resource to interact with. It would be appropriate to use it as the value of the resource parameter.

I.e., Logto management API base URI

```
https://api.logto.io
```

By default, this API resource is pre-registered. All the management APIs under this URI are protected by Logto server.

### Logto API Resource Schema

## How does it work

### 1. Authorization request

When the resource parameter is used in an authorization request to the authorization endpoint, it indicates the identity of the protected resource(s) to which access is being requested.

```bash
GET https://logto.dev/oidc/auth?response_type=code
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &state=tNwzQ87pC6llebpmac_IDeeq-mCR2wLDYljHUZUAWuI
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &resource=https%3A%2F%2Flogto.dev%2Fapi%2Fapplications
    &resource=https%3A%2F%2Flogto.dev%2Fapi%2Fusers
```

Logto will validate and process these resource indicators and grant the `authorization_code`.

### 2. Access Token request

When the resource parameter is used on an access token request made to the token endpoint, it indicates the target service or protected resource where the client intends to use the requested access token.

```bash
POST https://logto.dev/oidc/token HTTP/1.1

    grant_type=authorization_code
    redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    code=10esc29BWC2qZB0acc9v8zAv9ltc2pko105tQauZ
    resource=https%3A%2F%2Flogto.test.dev%2Fusers
```

An access token with the audience restricted to the requested resource will be granted by Logto.

### 3. API resource request

Client sent a request to the API resource with `access_token` provided in the Authorization header. Audience info and token expiration time are encoded in the encrypted `access_token`.

```bash
GET https://logto.dev/api/users

Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwiYXVkIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9sb2d0by5kZXYvYXBpL3VzZXJzIiwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9sb2d0by5kZXYvb2lkYyIsIm5hbWUiOiJKb2huIERvZSIsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMiwiZXhwIjoxNTE2MzI1NDIyfQ.PjIJl00YNC84EPNYLEdpEEAdAxqhekCYhFEckvRokek
