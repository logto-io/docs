# üìÅ API Resource

## Introduction

### What is an API Resource?

API Resources, a.k.a. [Resource Indicators](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html), indicate the target services or resources to be requested, usually, a URI format variable representing the resource's identity.

### Why is API Resource needed?

Logto, as an authorization server, is designed to serve a large number of services and APIs. By indicating which API Resource an end-user intends to access, Logto can issue a private encrypted authorization token and apply audience restrictions accordingly.

A guarded request with an authorization token provided will help you protect your private resources from being accessed and attacked by anonymous identities.

## Definitions

### Resource Indicator

- A resource value indicates the target service or resource to which access is being requested.
- Its value **MUST** be an absolute URI.
- The URI **MUST NOT** include a fragment component.
- It **SHOULD NOT** include a query component.
- You **SHOULD** provide the most specific URI it can for the complete API or set of resources it intends to access.

In practice, a client may know a base URI or the application or resource to interact with. It would be appropriate to use it as the value of the resource parameter.

E.g., Logto management API base URI.

```
https://tenantId.logto.app/api
```

By default, this API Resource is pre-registered to your Logto service. All the management APIs under this URI are protected by Logto.

### Logto API Resource Schema

### Default API

Logto leverages [RFC 8707: Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707) to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). While it is one of the features of OAuth 2.0, it is not yet widely supported.

In Logto's implementation, every user-defined permission (scope) must be associated with an API Resource. Otherwise, it will be treated as an OpenID Connect (or OAuth) permission. Generally, this doesn't affect your authorization process. However, when integrating with third-party apps that lack support for RFC 8707 (e.g., ChatGPT plugins), it can pose challenges since the initial authorization request may not include a `resource` parameter. Consequently, Logto will always issue Opaque Access Tokens.

To address this issue, you can designate an API Resource as the tenant-level default resource. Once it is done:

- Logto will use the default API Resource when no `resource` parameter is present in the [Authentication Request](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest).
- If the `openid` scope is included, an Opaque Access Token for the [Userinfo Endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo) will be issued when no `resource` parameter is present in subsequent [Token Requests](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenRequest).
- If the `openid` scope is not included, a JWT Access Token for the default API Resource will be issued when no `resource` parameter is present in subsequent [Token Requests](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenRequest).

By designating a default API Resource, you can ensure smooth integration with apps lacking RFC 8707 support while maintaining the appropriate access controls.

### Permissions and Role-Based Access Control

See [üîê Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/docs/recipes/rbac) for details.

## How does it work

### 1. Authentication request

Provide a list of resource indicator parameters in an [Authentication Request](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest). It will indicate all the protected resource(s) that the user may request.

```bash
GET http://localhost:3001/oidc/auth?response_type=code
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &state=tNwzQ87pC6llebpmac_IDeeq-mCR2wLDYljHUZUAWuI
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &resource=https%3A%2F%2Flogto.dev%2Fapi%2Fapplications
    &resource=https%3A%2F%2Flogto.dev%2Fapi%2Fusers
```

Logto will validate and store these resource indicators. An `authorization_code` will be granted and returned with scopes restricted to these specified resources.

### 2. Token request

When the resource parameter is present on a [Token Request](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenRequest) along with the `authorization_code` granted above, it will specify the target API Resource audience of the access token is requested.

```bash
POST http://localhost:3001/oidc/token HTTP/1.1

    grant_type=authorization_code
    redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    code=10esc29BWC2qZB0acc9v8zAv9ltc2pko105tQauZ
    resource=https%3A%2F%2Flogto.test.dev%2Fusers
```

An encrypted access token with the audience restricted to this requested resource will be granted by Logto. The token carries all the data you will need to represent the authorization status of the request. E.g., the request user's identity and role, the token's audience and expiration time.

### 3. Request to the API Resource

The client user sent a request to the API Resource by presenting the given `access_token` in the Authorization header.

```bash
GET http://localhost:3001/api/users

Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUz...
```
