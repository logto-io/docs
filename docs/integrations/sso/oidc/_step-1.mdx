Initiate the OIDC SSO integration by creating an application on the IdP side. You will need to provide the following configurations from the Logto server.

- **Callback URI**: The Logto Callback URI, also known as the Redirect URI or Reply URL, is a specific endpoint or URL that the IdP uses to redirect the user's browser after successful authentication. After a user successfully authenticates with the IdP, the IdP redirects the user's browser back to this designated URI along with an authorization code. Logto will complete the authentication process based on authorization code received from this URI.

Fill in the Logto Callback URI in your IdP OIDC application settings form and continue to create the application. (Most of the OIDC IdPs provide a wide range of application types to choose from. To create a web-based SSO connector on Logto, please choose the `Web Application` type.)
