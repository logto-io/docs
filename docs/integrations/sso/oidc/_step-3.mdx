Scopes define the permissions your app requests from users and control which data your app can access from their enterprise accounts.

Setting up scopes requires configuration on both sides:

1. **Your Identity Provider (IdP)**: Configure which permissions are allowed for authorization in your IdP console
   - Some IdPs enable all public scopes by default (no action needed)
   - Others require you to explicitly grant permissions
2. **Logto enterprise connector**: Specify which scopes to request during authentication in the Logto OIDC enterprise connector settings > `Scopes` field.
   - Logto always includes the `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scopes to retrieve basic user identity information, regardless of your custom scope settings.
   - You can add additional scopes (separated by spaces) to request more information from the IdP.

:::tip
If your app needs to access APIs using these scopes, make sure to enable **Store tokens for persistent API access** in your Logto enterprise connector. See the next section for details.
