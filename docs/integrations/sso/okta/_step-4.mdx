Scopes define the permissions your app requests from users and control which data your app can access from their Okta accounts. Requesting additional Okta permissions requires configuration on both sides:

**In Okta admin console:**

1. Navigate to **Applications > Applications** and select your OIDC application.
2. Go to the **Assignments** tab to ensure your app has access to the required users and groups.
3. For custom scopes, navigate to **Security > API > Authorization Servers** and select your authorization server.
4. Add custom scopes if needed:
   - Click **Scopes** and then **Add Scope**
   - Define scope names like `okta.users.read` or `okta.groups.read` for accessing Okta APIs
   - Configure consent requirements for each scope

For a complete list of available scopes and their descriptions, please refer to the [Okta OIDC documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/guides/overview/#scopes).

**In Logto Okta connector:**

1. Logto automatically includes `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scopes to retrieve basic user identity information. You can leave the `Scopes` field blank if you only need basic user information.
2. Add `offline_access` to the `Scopes` field if you plan to store tokens for persistent API access. This scope enables refresh tokens for long-lived API access.
3. Add additional scopes (separated by spaces) in the `Scopes` field to request more data from Okta. For example: `okta.users.read okta.groups.read`

:::tip

If your app requests these scopes to access Okta APIs and perform actions, make sure to enable **Store tokens for persistent API access** in Logto Okta connector. See the next section for details.
