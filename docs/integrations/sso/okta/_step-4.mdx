Use the `Scope` field to add additional scopes to your OAuth request. This will allow you to request more information from the Okta OAuth server. Please refer to the [Okta documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#scopes) for more details about the available scopes.

Regardless of the custom scope settings, Logto will always send the `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scopes to the IdP. This is to ensure that Logto can retrieve the user's identity information and email address properly.
