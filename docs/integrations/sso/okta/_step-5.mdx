If you want to access [Okta scopes](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/request-user-consent/main/#enable-consent-for-scopes) and perform actions with user authorization, Logto needs to get specific scopes and store tokens.

1. Add the required scopes in your Okta developer console API permissions configuration and Logto Okta connector.
2. Enable **Store tokens for persistent API access** in Logto Okta connector. Logto will securely store Okta access and refresh tokens in the Secret Vault.
3. To ensure refresh tokens are returned, add the `offline_access` scope to your Okta application permissions and include it in your Logto Okta connector scopes. This scope allows your application to maintain access to resources for extended periods.
