Copy the `client ID` and `client secret` and fill in the corresponding fields on the Logto SSO connector `Connection` tab.

Use your Okta domain as the `issuer`. Example: `https://dev-12345678.okta.com`. Once you have filled in all the fields, click the `Save` button to save the connector settings.

If the `issuer` link you provided is valid, you will see a parsed full list of Okta IdP configurations shown below the `issuer` field.
