To make the SAML SSO integration work, you will need to provide the IdP metadata back to Logto. Let's switch back to the Logto side, and navigate to the `Connection` tab of your Azure AD SSO connector.

Logto provides three different ways to configure the IdP metadata. The easiest way is by providing the `metadata URL` of the Azure AD SSO application.

Copy the `App Federation Metadata Url` from your Azure AD SSO application's `SAML Certificates section` and paste it into the `Metadata URL` field in Logto.

Logto will fetch the metadata from the URL and configure the SAML SSO integration automatically.
