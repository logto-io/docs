Continue setting up the OAuth credential by filling up the following information:

1. Select the `Web application` as the application type.
2. Fill in the `Name` of your client application, `Logto SSO Connector` for example. This will help you to identify the credentials in the future.
3. Fill in the `Authorized redirect URIs` with the Logto callback URI. This is the URI that Google will redirect the user's browser after successful authentication. After a user successfully authenticates with the IdP, the IdP redirects the user's browser back to this designated URI along with an authorization code. Logto will complete the authentication process based on the authorization code received from this URI.
4. Fill in the `Authorized JavaScript origins` with the Logto callback URI's origin. This ensures only your Logto application can send requests to the Google OAuth server.
5. Click the `Create` button to create the OAuth credential.
