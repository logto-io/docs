Scopes define the permissions your app requests from users and control which data your app can access from their Google Workspace accounts. Requesting Google permissions requires configuration on both sides:

**In Google Cloud Console:**

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen > Scopes**.
2. Click **Add or Remove Scopes** and select only the scopes your app requires:
   - Authentication (Required):
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile`
     - `openid`
   - API access (Optional): Add any additional scopes needed for your app (e.g., Drive, Calendar, YouTube). Browse the [Google API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) to find available services. If your app needs access to Google APIs beyond basic permissions, first enable the specific APIs your app will use (e.g., Google Drive API, Gmail API, Calendar API) in the Google API Library.
3. Click **Update** to confirm the selection.
4. Click **Save and Continue** to apply the changes.

**In Logto Google Workspace connector:**

1. Logto automatically includes `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scopes to retrieve basic user identity information. You can leave the `Scopes` field blank if you only need basic user information
2. Add additional scopes (separated by spaces) in the `Scopes` field to request more data from Google. Use full scope URLs, for example: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`

:::tip
If your app requests these scopes to access the Google API and perform actions, make sure to enable **Store tokens for persistent API access** in Logto Google connector. See the next section for details.
