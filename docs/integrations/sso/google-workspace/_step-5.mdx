Use the `Scope` field to add additional scopes to your OAuth request. This will allow you to request more information from the Google OAuth server. Please refer to the [Google OAuth Scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) documentation for more information.

Regardless of the custom scope settings, Logto will always send the `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scopes to the IdP. This is to ensure that Logto can retrieve the user's identity information and email address properly.
