# Set up social login with Facebook

Integrate Facebook OAuth 2.0 authentication system to enable Sign-in with Facebook, account linking, and secure access to Facebook APIs.

<GuideTip />

## Get started \{#get-started}

The Facebook connector enables OAuth 2.0 integration to let your application:

- Add “Sign-in with Facebook” authentication
- Link user accounts to Facebook identities
- Sync user profile info from Facebook
- Access Facebook APIs through secure token storage in Logto Secret Vault for automation tasks (e.g.,reply to thread; publish content and videos in your app)

To set up these authentication features, create a Facebook connector in Logto first:

1. Go to [Logto > Connector > Social connector](https://cloud.logto.io/to/connectors/social).
2. Click **Add social connector,** select **Facebook**, click **Next**, and follow the step-by-step tutorial to complete the integration.

<Integration />

## Utilize the Facebook connector \{#utilize-the-facebook-connector}

Once you've created a Facebook connector and connected it to Facebook, you can incorporate it into your end-user flows. Choose the options that match your needs:

### Enable "Sign-in with Facebook" \{#enable-sign-in-with-facebook}

1. In Logto Console, go to <CloudLink to="/sign-in-experience/sign-up-and-sign-in">Sign-in experience > Sign-up and sign-in</CloudLink>
2. Add the Facebook connector under **Social sign-in** section to let users authenticate with Facebook

Learn more about [social sign-in experience](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/social-sign-in).

### Link or unlink a Facebook account \{#link-or-unlink-a-facebook-account}

Use the Account API to build a custom Account Center in your app that lets signed-in users link or unlink their Facebook account. [Follow the Account API tutorial](/end-user-flows/account-settings/by-account-api#link-a-new-social-connection)

:::tip
It's allowed to enable the Facebook connector only for account linking and API access, without enabling it for social sign-in.
:::

### Access Facebook API and perform actions \{#access-facebook-api-and-perform-actions}

Your application can retrieve stored Facebook access tokens from the Secret Vault to call Facebook APIs and automate backend tasks (for example, publishing content or managing posts). Refer to the guide on retrieving stored tokens for API access.

## Manage user's Facebook identity \{#manage-user-s-facebook-identity}

After a user links their Facebook account, admins can manage that connection in the Logto Console:

1. Navigate to <CloudLink to="/users">User management</CloudLink> and open the user's profile.
2. Under **Social connections**, locate the Facebook item and click **Manage**.
3. On this page, admins can manage the user's Facebook connection, see all profile information granted and synced from their Facebook account, and check the access token status.

:::note
Facebook's access token response does not include the specific scope information, so Logto cannot directly display the list of permissions granted by the user. However, as long as the user has consented to the requested scopes during authorization, your application will have the corresponding permissions when accessing the Facebook API. It is recommended to accurately configure the required scopes in both the Facebook Developer Console and Logto to ensure your app has the necessary access.
