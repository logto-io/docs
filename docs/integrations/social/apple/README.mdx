# Set up social login with Apple

The official Logto connector for Apple social sign-in.

<GuideTip />

## Get started \{#get-started}

If you don't know the concept of the connector or don't know how to add this connector to your Sign-in experience, please see [Logto tutorial](/connectors/social-connectors).

### Pitfalls of configuring scope \{#pitfalls-of-configuring-scope}

If you have configured your app to request users' email addresses after they have already signed in with Apple, you will not be able to retrieve the email addresses for those existing users, even if they sign in again using Apple ID. To address this, you need to instruct your users to visit the [Apple ID account management page](https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage) and remove your application from the "Sign in with Apple" section. This can be done by selecting "Stop using Apple Sign In" on your app's detail page.

For instance, if your app requests both the users' email and name (`email name` scope), the consent screen that new users see during their first sign-in should look similar to this:

## Test Apple connector \{#test-apple-connector}

That's it. The Apple connector should be available in both web and native apps. Don't forget to [Enable social connector in sign-in experience](/connectors/social-connectors/#enable-social-sign-in).
