# Set up social login with WeChat (Native)

The official Logto connector for WeChat social sign-in in native apps (iOS and Android).

<GuideTip />

## Get started \{#get-started}

If you don't know the concept of the connector or don't know how to add this connector to your Sign-in experience, please see [Logto tutorial](/connectors/social-connectors).

In native apps, you cannot use the web as a sign-in method of WeChat: navigation to the WeChat app is required, and it also requires using their SDK.

We know it sounds scary, but don't worry. We'll handle it easily in this tutorial.

<Integration />

## Test WeChat native connector \{#test-wechat-native-connector}

That's it. Don't forget to [Enable social connector in sign-in experience](/connectors/social-connectors/#enable-social-sign-in).

Once WeChat native connector is enabled, you can build and run your app to see if it works.

:::caution

WeChat doesn't have a plan for those devices without the WeChat app installed. Logto will hide this connector during sign-in if so (which is the recommended way from the [official development guide](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/oplatform/en/Mobile_App/WeChat_Login/Development_Guide.html)).
