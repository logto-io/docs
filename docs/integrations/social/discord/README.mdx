# Discord OAuth2 Connector

The Discord connector provides a way for your application to use Discord as an authorization system.

**Table of contents**

- [Discord OAuth2 Connector](#discord-oauth2-connector)
  - [Register a developer application](#register-a-developer-application)
  - [Configure Logto](#configure-logto)
    - [Config types](#config-types)
      - [clientId](#clientid)
      - [clientSecret](#clientsecret)
      - [scope](#scope)

## Register a developer application

- Visit [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and sign in with your Discord account.
- Click the **New Application** button to create an application, choose a name for it (Ex: LogtoAuth), tick the box and click **Create**.
- Go to **OAuth2** page and click **Reset Secret**
- Take note of the **CLIENT ID** and **CLIENT SECRET** fields
- Add the valid redirects (Ex: **`http://auth.mycompany.io/callback/${connector_id}`**). The `connector_id` can be found on the top bar of the Logto Admin Console connector details page.

## Configure Logto

### Config types

| Name         | Type   |
| ------------ | ------ |
| clientId     | string |
| clientSecret | string |
| scope        | string |

#### clientId

`clientId` is the `CLIENT ID` field we saved earlier.
(You can find it in the Oauth2 Page in Discord Developer Portal.)

#### clientSecret

`clientSecret` is the `CLIENT SECRET` we saved earlier.
(If you've lost it you need to click **Reset Secret**)

#### scope

`scope` is the permissions granted by the user's authorization. The default value is `identify email`.
You can see the full list of scopes [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes).
