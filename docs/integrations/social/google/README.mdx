# Set up social login with Google

Integrate Google OAuth 2.0 authentication system to enable Sign-in with Google, account linking, and secure access to Google APIs.

<GuideTip />

## Get started \{#get-started}

The Google connector enables OAuth 2.0 integration to let your application:

- Add "Sign-in with Google" authentication
- Link user accounts to Google identities
- Sync user profile info from Google
- Access Google APIs through secure token storage in Logto Secret Vault for automation tasks (e.g., editing Google Docs, managing Calendar events in your app)

To set up these authentication features, create a Google connector in Logto first:

1. Go to <CloudLink to="/connectors/social">Logto console > Connector > Social connector</CloudLink>.
2. Click **Add social connector**, select **Google**, click **Next**, and follow the step-by-step tutorial to complete the integration.

<Integration />

## Utilize the Google connector \{#utilize-the-google-connector}

Once you've created a Google connector and connected it to Google, you can incorporate it into your end-user flows. Choose the options that match your needs:

### Enable "Sign-in with Google" \{#enable-sign-in-with-google}

1. In Logto Console, go to <CloudLink to="/sign-in-experience/sign-up-and-sign-in">Sign-in experience > Sign-up and sign-in</CloudLink>.
2. Add the Google connector under **Social sign-in** section to let users authenticate with Google.
3. Optionally enable **Google One Tap** on the sign-in and sign-up pages for a streamlined authentication experience.

Learn more about [social sign-in experience](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/social-sign-in).

### Link or unlink a Google account \{#link-or-unlink-a-google-account}

Use the Account API to build a custom Account Center in your app that lets signed-in users link or unlink their Google account. [Follow the Account API tutorial](/end-user-flows/account-settings/by-account-api#link-a-new-social-connection)

:::tip
It's allowed to enable the Google connector only for account linking and API access, without enabling it for social sign-in.
:::

### Access Google APIs and perform actions \{#access-google-apis-and-perform-actions}

Your application can retrieve stored Google access tokens from the Secret Vault to call Google APIs and automate backend tasks (for example, managing Google Drive files, creating Calendar events, or sending emails through Gmail). Refer to the guide on retrieving stored tokens for API access.

## Manage user's Google identity \{#manage-user-s-google-identity}

After a user links their Google account, admins can manage that connection in the Logto Console:

1. Navigate to <CloudLink to="/users">Logto console > User management</CloudLink> and open the user's profile.
2. Under **Social connections**, locate the Google item and click **Manage**.
3. On this page, admins can manage the user's Google connection, see all profile information granted and synced from their Google account, and check the access token status.
