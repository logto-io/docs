# Set up social login with GitHub via GitHub App

Integrate GitHub App to enable Sign-in with GitHub, account linking, and secure access to GitHub APIs with fine-grained permissions and refresh tokens.

## GitHub App vs OAuth App \{#github-app-vs-oauth-app}

GitHub offers two types of apps for authentication and API access: **GitHub Apps** and **OAuth Apps**. Here's a comparison to help you choose:

| Feature                   | GitHub App                                                              | OAuth App                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Permissions**           | Fine-grained permissions — request access to specific resources only    | Broad scopes — often grants more access than needed |
| **Permission management** | Configured in GitHub dashboard only; Logto's `Scope` field can be empty | Configured via scopes in Logto connector            |
| **Refresh tokens**        | Always issued during OAuth flow                                         | Not supported — tokens never expire unless revoked  |
| **Token expiration**      | Access tokens expire after 8 hours; refresh tokens valid for 6 months   | Access tokens never expire                          |
| **User control**          | Users can choose which repositories the app can access                  | Access to all repositories the user has access to   |
| **Rate limits**           | Higher rate limits that scale with installations                        | Lower rate limits (5,000 requests/hour per user)    |
| **Installation**          | Installed on accounts/organizations with granular repository access     | Authorized by users with broad access               |
| **Webhooks**              | Built-in centralized webhook support                                    | Must be configured separately for each repository   |
| **Acting independently**  | Can act on its own behalf (server-to-server)                            | Always acts on behalf of a user                     |

**When to use GitHub App:**

- You need fine-grained control over permissions and repository access
- You want refresh tokens for long-term API access with enhanced security
- You need higher API rate limits
- You want to perform automated tasks independent of user sessions

**When to use OAuth App:**

- Simple sign-in integration with minimal API access
- You need tokens that don't expire (for legacy integrations)
- You need to access enterprise-level resources (GitHub Apps don't yet support enterprise-level permissions)

:::tip
GitHub recommends GitHub Apps over OAuth Apps for most use cases due to their enhanced security features and fine-grained permissions. Learn more about the [differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps).

## Get started \{#get-started}

The GitHub App connector enables OAuth 2.0 integration to let your application:

- Add "Sign-in with GitHub" authentication
- Link user accounts to GitHub identities
- Sync user profile info from GitHub
- Access GitHub APIs through secure token storage in Logto Secret Vault for automation tasks (e.g., creating GitHub issues, managing repositories from your app)
- Use **refresh tokens** (always issued by GitHub Apps) to maintain long-term API access without requiring users to re-authenticate

To set up these authentication features, create a GitHub connector in Logto first:

1. Go to <CloudLink to="/connectors/social">Logto console > Connector > Social connector</CloudLink>.
2. Click **Add social connector**, select **GitHub App**, click **Next**, and follow the step-by-step tutorial to complete the integration.

<Integration />

## Utilize the GitHub connector \{#utilize-the-github-connector}

Once you've created a GitHub connector and connected it to GitHub, you can incorporate it into your end-user flows. Choose the options that match your needs:

### Enable "Sign-in with GitHub" \{#enable-sign-in-with-github}

1. In Logto Console, go to <CloudLink to="/sign-in-experience/sign-up-and-sign-in">Sign-in experience > Sign-up and sign-in</CloudLink>.
2. Add the GitHub connector under **Social sign-in** section to let users authenticate with GitHub.

Learn more about [social sign-in experience](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/social-sign-in).

### Link or unlink a GitHub account \{#link-or-unlink-a-github-account}

Use the Account API to build a custom Account Center in your app that lets signed-in users link or unlink their GitHub account. [Follow the Account API tutorial](/end-user-flows/account-settings/by-account-api#link-a-new-social-connection)

:::tip
It's allowed to enable the GitHub connector only for account linking and API access, without enabling it for social sign-in.
:::

### Access GitHub APIs and perform actions \{#access-github-apis-and-perform-actions}

Your application can retrieve stored GitHub tokens from the Secret Vault to call GitHub APIs and automate backend tasks (for example, creating issues, managing repositories, or automating workflows). Refer to the guide on retrieving stored tokens for API access.

Since GitHub Apps always issue refresh tokens during the OAuth flow, Logto stores both access tokens and refresh tokens. Access tokens expire after 8 hours, but Logto automatically uses the refresh token (valid for 6 months) to obtain new access tokens, ensuring uninterrupted API access.

## Manage user's GitHub identity \{#manage-user-s-github-identity}

After a user links their GitHub account, admins can manage that connection in the Logto Console:

1. Navigate to <CloudLink to="/users">Logto console > User management</CloudLink> and open the user's profile.
2. Under **Social connections**, locate the GitHub item and click **Manage**.
3. On this page, admins can manage the user's GitHub connection, see all profile information granted and synced from their GitHub account, and check the access token and refresh token status.

:::note
Unlike OAuth Apps that use scopes, GitHub Apps use fine-grained permissions that are configured in the GitHub dashboard. The user access token is limited to the permissions that both your app and the user have. Logto cannot directly display the list of permissions, but your application will have access based on the permissions configured in your GitHub App settings.
