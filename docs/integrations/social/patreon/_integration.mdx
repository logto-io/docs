## Sign in with Patreon account

Go to the [Patreon website](https://www.patreon.com/) and sign in with your Patreon account. You may register a new account if you don't have one.

## Create and configure OAuth app

Follow the [creating a Patreon OAuth App](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients) guide, and register a new application.

Name your new OAuth application in **App Name** and fill in **App URL** of the app. You can leave the **App Description** field blank and customize the **Redirect URIs** as `${your_logto_origin}/callback/${connector_id}`. The `connector_id` can be found on the top bar of the Logto Admin Console connector details page.

:::note
If you encounter the error message "The redirect_uri MUST match the registered callback URL for this application." when logging in, try aligning the Redirect URI of your Patreon OAuth App and your Logto App's redirect URL (including the protocol) to resolve the issue.

## Managing OAuth apps

Go to the [Clients & API Keys page](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients) on Patreon, where you can add, edit, or delete existing OAuth apps. You can also find the `Client ID` and generate `Client secrets` in the OAuth app detail pages.

## Configure your connector

Fill out the `clientId` and `clientSecret` field with the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ you've got from the OAuth app detail pages mentioned in the previous section.

`scope` is a space-delimited list of [scopes](https://docs.patreon.com/#scopes). If not provided, the scope defaults to `identity identity[email]`.

### Config types

| Name         | Type   |
| ------------ | ------ |
| clientId     | string |
| clientSecret | string |
| scope        | string |
