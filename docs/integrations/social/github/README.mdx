# Set up social login with GitHub via OAuth App

Integrate GitHub OAuth App to enable Sign-in with GitHub, account linking, and secure access to GitHub APIs.

<GuideTip />

## Get started \{#get-started}

The GitHub connector enables OAuth 2.0 integration to let your application:

- Add "Sign-in with GitHub" authentication
- Link user accounts to GitHub identities
- Sync user profile info from GitHub
- Access GitHub APIs through secure token storage in Logto Secret Vault for automation tasks (e.g., creating GitHub issues, managing repositories from your app)

To set up these authentication features, create a GitHub connector in Logto first:

1. Go to <CloudLink to="/connectors/social">Logto console > Connector > Social connector</CloudLink>.
2. Click **Add social connector**, select **GitHub**, click **Next**, and follow the step-by-step tutorial to complete the integration.

<Integration />

## Utilize the GitHub connector \{#utilize-the-github-connector}

Once you've created a GitHub connector and connected it to GitHub, you can incorporate it into your end-user flows. Choose the options that match your needs:

### Enable "Sign-in with GitHub" \{#enable-sign-in-with-github}

1. In Logto Console, go to <CloudLink to="/sign-in-experience/sign-up-and-sign-in">Sign-in experience > Sign-up and sign-in</CloudLink>.
2. Add the GitHub connector under **Social sign-in** section to let users authenticate with GitHub.

Learn more about [social sign-in experience](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/social-sign-in).

### Link or unlink a GitHub account \{#link-or-unlink-a-github-account}

Use the Account API to build a custom Account Center in your app that lets signed-in users link or unlink their GitHub account. [Follow the Account API tutorial](/end-user-flows/account-settings/by-account-api#link-a-new-social-connection)

:::tip
It's allowed to enable the GitHub connector only for account linking and API access, without enabling it for social sign-in.
:::

### Access GitHub APIs and perform actions \{#access-github-apis-and-perform-actions}

Your application can retrieve stored GitHub access tokens from the Secret Vault to call GitHub APIs and automate backend tasks (for example, creating issues, managing repositories, or automating workflows). Refer to the guide on retrieving stored tokens for API access.

## Manage user's GitHub identity \{#manage-user-s-github-identity}

After a user links their GitHub account, admins can manage that connection in the Logto Console:

1. Navigate to <CloudLink to="/users">Logto console > User management</CloudLink> and open the user's profile.
2. Under **Social connections**, locate the GitHub item and click **Manage**.
3. On this page, admins can manage the user's GitHub connection, see all profile information granted and synced from their GitHub account, and check the access token status.

:::note
GitHub's access token response does not include the specific scope information, so Logto cannot directly display the list of permissions granted by the user. However, as long as the user has consented to the requested scopes during authorization, your application will have the corresponding permissions when accessing the GitHub API.
