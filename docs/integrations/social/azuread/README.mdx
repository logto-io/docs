# Microsoft Azure AD connector

The Microsoft Azure AD connector provides a succinct way for your application to use Azureâ€™s OAuth 2.0 authentication system.

## Set up Microsoft Azure AD in the Azure Portal

- Visit the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and sign in with your Azure account. You need to have an active subscription to access Microsoft Azure AD.
- Click the **Azure Active Directory** from the services they offer, and click the **App Registrations** from the left menu.
- Click **New Registration** at the top, enter a description, select your **access type** and add your **Redirect URI**, which will redirect the user to the application after logging in. In our case, this will be `${your_logto_endpoint}/callback/${connector_id}`. e.g. `https://foo.logto.app/callback/${connector_id}`. (The `connector_id` can be also found on the top bar of the Logto Admin Console connector details page)
  > You can copy the `Callback URI` in the configuration section.
- Select Web as Platform.

## Fill in the configuration in Logto

| Name          | Type   |
| ------------- | ------ |
| clientId      | string |
| clientSecret  | string |
| tenantId      | string |
| cloudInstance | string |

### Client ID

You may find the **Application (client) ID** in the **Overview** section of your newly created application in the Azure Portal.

### Client Secret

- In your newly created application, click the **Certificates & Secrets** to get a client secret, and click the **New client secret** from the top.
- Enter a description and an expiration.
- This will only show your client secret once. Fill the **value** to the Logto connector configuration and save it to a secure location.

### Cloud Instance

Usually, it is `https://login.microsoftonline.com/`. See [Azure AD authentication endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-national-cloud#azure-ad-authentication-endpoints) for more information.

### Tenant ID

Logto will use this field to construct the authorization endpoints. This value is dependent on the **access type** you selected when creating the application in the Azure Portal.

- If you select **Accounts in this organizational directory only** for access type then you need to enter your **\{TenantID}**. You can find the tenant ID in the **Overview** section of your Azure Active Directory.
- If you select **Accounts in any organizational directory** for access type then you need to enter **organizations**.
- If you select **Accounts in any organizational directory or personal Microsoft accounts** for access type then you need to enter **common**.
- If you select **Personal Microsoft accounts only** for access type then you need to enter **consumers**.
