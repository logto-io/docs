## Sign in with GitLab account \{#sign-in-with-gitlab-account}

Go to the [GitLab website](https://gitlab.com/) and sign in with your GitLab account. You may register a new account if you don't have one.

## Create and configure OAuth app \{#create-and-configure-oauth-app}

Follow the [creating a GitLab OAuth App](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html) guide, and register a new application.

Name your new OAuth application in **Name** and fill in **Redirect URI** of the app. Customize the **Redirect URIs** as `${your_logto_origin}/callback/${connector_id}`. The `connector_id` can be found on the top bar of the Logto Admin Console connector details page.

On scopes, select `openid`. You may also want to enable `profile` and `email`. The `profile` scope is required to get the user's profile information, and the `email` scope is required to get the user's email address. Ensure you have allowed these scopes in your GitLab OAuth app if you want to use them. These scopes will also be used when configuring your connector later.

:::note

- If you use custom domains, add both the custom domain and the default Logto domain to the Redirect URIs to ensure the OAuth flow works correctly with both domains.
- If you encounter the error message "The redirect_uri MUST match the registered callback URL for this application." when logging in, try aligning the Redirect URI of your GitLab OAuth App and your Logto App's redirect URL (including the protocol) to resolve the issue.

## Managing OAuth apps \{#managing-oauth-apps}

Go to the [Applications page](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/applications) on GitLab, where you can add, edit, or delete existing OAuth apps. You can also find the `Application ID` and generate `Secret` in the OAuth app detail pages.

## Configure your connector \{#configure-your-connector}

Fill out the `clientId` and `clientSecret` field with the _Application ID_ and _Secret_ you've got from the OAuth app detail pages mentioned in the previous section.

`scope` is a space-delimited list of [scopes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#authorized-applications). If not provided, scope defaults to be `openid`. For GitLab connector, the scope you may want to use are `openid`, `profile` and `email`. `profile` scope is required to get the user's profile information, and `email` scope is required to get the user's email address. Ensure you have allowed these scopes in your GitLab OAuth app (configured in [Create and configure OAuth app](#create-and-configure-oauth-app) section).

### Config types \{#config-types}

| Name         | Type   |
| ------------ | ------ |
| clientId     | string |
| clientSecret | string |
| scope        | string |

## Test GitLab connector \{#test-gitlab-connector}

That's it. The GitLab connector should be available now. Don't forget to [Enable connector in sign-in experience](https://docs.logto.io/docs/recipes/configure-connectors/social-connector/enable-social-sign-in/).
