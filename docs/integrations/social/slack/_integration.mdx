### Set up Slack App \{#set-up-slack-app}

Go to the [Slack API: Applications](https://api.slack.com/apps) and sign in with your Slack account. If you donâ€™t have an account, you can register for one.

Then, create an app.

**Step 1:** Find `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

You can find the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` on the **"Basic Information"** section.

**Step 2:** Set up redirect URLs.

Go to the **"OAuth & Permissions"** section, you can find the **"Redirect URLs"** form.

In our case, this will be `${your_logto_endpoint}/callback/${connector_id}`. e.g. `https://foo.logto.app/callback/${connector_id}`. The `connector_id` can be found on the top bar of the Logto Admin Console connector details page.

You can refer to the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack) for more details.

### Configure your connector \{#configure-your-connector}

In your Logto connector configuration, fill out the following fields with the values obtained from your App's "Keys and tokens" page's "OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret" section:

- **clientId:** Your App's Client ID.
- **clientSecret:** Your App's Client Secret.

`scope` is a space-delimited list of OpenID scopes. If not provided, the default scope is `openid profile`.
