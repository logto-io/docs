# Set up social login with Alipay (Native)

The official Logto connector for Alipay social sign-in in mobile-device native apps.

<GuideTip />

## Get started \{#get-started}

Alipay Native connector works closely with Logto SDK on mobile platforms. It takes advantage of Alipay's OAuth 2.0 authentication workflow and enables Alipay users to sign in to other Apps using public Alipay user profiles without going through a troublesome register process.

<Integration />

### Test Alipay native connector \{#test-alipay-native-connector}

That's it. Don't forget to [Enable social connector in sign-in experience](/connectors/social-connectors/#enable-social-sign-in).

Once Alipay native connector is enabled, you can build and run your app to see if it works.
