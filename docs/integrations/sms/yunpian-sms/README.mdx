The official Logto connector for YunPian SMS service.

<GuideTip />

## Get started \{#get-started}

YunPian is a communication service provider offering various services including SMS. The YunPian SMS Connector is a plugin provided by the Logto team to integrate with YunPian's SMS service, enabling Logto end-users to register and sign in via SMS verification codes.
