<GuideTip />

## Get started \{#get-started}

Vonage is a global communications provider, offering robust cloud-based communication services, including SMS (short message service). The Vonage SMS Connector is a plugin provided by the Logto team to enable Logto end-users to register and sign in to their Logto account via SMS verification codes.

To work with this connector, you will need to [sign up for an account](https://developer.vonage.com/en/account/guides/dashboard-management#create-and-configure-a-vonage-account) in Vonage. This will give you an API key and secret that you can use to access the APIs through this connector.

Once you have an account, you can find your API key and API secret at the top of the Vonage API Dashboard.

And you may need to [rant a virtual number](https://developer.vonage.com/en/numbers/guides/number-management#rent-a-virtual-number) to send SMS messages.

See the [Vonage SMS API](https://developer.vonage.com/en/messaging/sms/overview) for more information.
