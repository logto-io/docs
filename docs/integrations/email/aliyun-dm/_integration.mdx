## Set up an email service in Aliyun DirectMail Console \{#set-up-an-email-service-in-aliyun-directmail-console}

### Create an Aliyun account \{#create-an-aliyun-account}

Head to [Aliyun](https://aliyun.com/) and create your Aliyun account if you don't have one.

### Enable and configure Aliyun Direct Mail \{#enable-and-configure-aliyun-direct-mail}

Go to the [DM service console page](https://www.aliyun.com/product/directmail) and sign in. Enable the Direct Mail service by clicking the "Apply to enable" (申请开通) button on the top left of the page and begin the configuration process.

Starting from the [DM admin console page](https://dm.console.aliyun.com/), you should:

1. Go to "Email Domains" (发信域名) from the sidebar and add "New Domain" (新建域名) following the instructions.
2. Customize "Sender Addresses" (发信地址) and "Email Tags" (邮件标签) respectively.

After finishing setup, there are two different ways to test:

- Go to the [DirectMail Overview page](https://dm.console.aliyun.com/), find "Operation Guide" (操作引导) at the bottom of the page, and click on "Send Emails" (发送邮件). You will find all the different kinds of testing methods.
- Follow the path "Send Emails" (发送邮件) -> "Email Tasks" (发送邮件) in the sidebar to create a testing task.

## Compose the connector JSON \{#compose-the-connector-json}

1. From the [DM admin console page](https://dm.console.aliyun.com/), hover on your avatar in the top right corner and go to "AccessKey Management" (AccessKey 管理), and click "Create AccessKey" (创建 AccessKey). You will get an "AccessKey ID" and "AccessKey Secret" pair after finishing security verification. Please keep them properly.
2. Go to the "Sender Addresses" (发信地址) or "Email Tags" (邮件标签) tab you just visited from the [DM admin console page](https://dm.console.aliyun.com/), you can find _Sender Address_ or _Email Tag_ easily.
3. Fill out the Aliyun DM Connector settings:
   - Fill out the `accessKeyId` and `accessKeySecret` fields with access key pairs you've got from step 1.
   - Fill out the `accountName` and `fromAlias` field with "Sender Address" and "Email Tag" which were found in step 2. All templates will share this signature name. (You can leave `fromAlias` blank as it is OPTIONAL.)
   - You can add multiple DM connector templates for different cases. Here is an example of adding a single template:
     - Fill out the `subject` field, which will work as title of the sending email.
     - Fill out the `content` field with arbitrary string-type contents. Do not forget to leave `{{code}}` placeholder for random verification code.
     - Fill out `usageType` field with either `Register`, `SignIn`, `ForgotPassword` or `Generic` for different use cases. (`usageType` is a Logto property to identify the proper use case.) In order to enable full user flows, templates with usageType `Register`, `SignIn`, `ForgotPassword` and `Generic` are required.

### Test Aliyun DM connector \{#test-aliyun-dm-connector}

You can type in an email address and click on "Send" to see whether the settings can work before "Save and Done".

That's it. Don't forget to [Enable connector in sign-in experience](/connectors/email-connectors/#enable-email-sign-up-or-sign-in).
