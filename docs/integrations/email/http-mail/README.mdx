# Set up email verification via HTTP call

The official Logto connector for HTTP email.

<GuideTip />

## Get started \{#get-started}

The HTTP email connector allows you to send emails via HTTP call. To use the HTTP email connector, you'll need to have your own email service that expose an HTTP API for sending emails. Logto will call this API when it needs to send an email. For example, when a user registers, Logto will call the HTTP API to send a verification email.

## Set up HTTP email connector \{#set-up-http-email-connector}

To use the HTTP email connector, you need to set up an HTTP endpoint that Logto can call. And an optional authorization token for the endpoint.

## Payload \{#payload}

The HTTP email connector sends a payload to the endpoint when triggering an email. It includes the recipient’s email (`to`), the email [usageType](/connectors/email-connectors/email-templates#email-template-types) indicating the authentication flow (`type`), and a `payload` containing available [variables](/connectors/email-connectors/email-templates#email-template-variables) (e.g., verification code, link, application info, organization info, user info) and the user’s [locale](/connectors/email-connectors/email-templates#email-template-localization).

Example:

```json
{
  "to": "foo@logto.io",
  "type": "SignIn",
  "payload": {
    "code": "123456"
    "locale": "de"
  }
}
```

You can use this information to customize email templates in your email delivery provider.

For all available types, see [Email template](/connectors/email-connectors/email-templates#email-template-types). The full `SendMessageData` type definition is in [connector-kit](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/tree/master/packages/toolkit/connector-kit/src/types/passwordless.ts).
