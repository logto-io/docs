To initialize a new Go project with Fiber, you can follow these steps:

```bash
go mod init your-api-name
go get github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2
```

Then, create a basic Fiber server setup:

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "log"

    "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
)

func main() {
    app := fiber.New()

    log.Fatal(app.Listen(":3000"))
}
```

:::note
Refer to the Fiber documentation for more details on how to set up routes, middleware, and other features.
