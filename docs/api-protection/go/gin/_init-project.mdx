To initialize a new Go project with Gin, you can follow these steps:

```bash
go mod init your-api-name
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
```

Then, create a basic Gin server setup:

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()

    r.Run(":3000") // listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:3000
}
```

:::note
Refer to the Gin documentation for more details on how to set up routes, middleware, and other features.
