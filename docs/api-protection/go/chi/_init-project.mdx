To initialize a new Go project with Chi, you can follow these steps:

```bash
go mod init your-api-name
go get github.com/go-chi/chi/v5
```

Then, create a basic Chi server setup:

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
)

func main() {
    r := chi.NewRouter()

    http.ListenAndServe(":3000", r)
}
```

:::note
Refer to the Chi documentation for more details on how to set up routes, middleware, and other features.
