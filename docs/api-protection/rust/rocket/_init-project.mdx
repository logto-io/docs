To initialize a new Rocket project, create a directory and set up the basic structure:

```bash
cargo new your-api-name
cd your-api-name
```

Add Rocket dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
rocket = { version = "0.5", features = ["json"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

Create a basic Rocket application:

```rust title="src/main.rs"
use rocket::{get, launch, routes, serde::json::Json};
use serde_json::{json, Value};

#[get("/")]
fn hello_handler() -> Json<Value> {
    Json(json!({ "message": "Hello from Rocket" }))
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build()
        .mount("/", routes![hello_handler])
}
```

Start the development server:

```bash
cargo run
```

:::note
Refer to the Rocket documentation for more details on how to set up routes, request guards, and other features.
