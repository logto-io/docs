To initialize a new Node.js project with Hapi, you can follow these steps:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @hapi/hapi
```

If you are using TypeScript, remember to set up your TypeScript environment accordingly.

Then, create a basic Hapi server setup:

```ts title="app.ts"
import Hapi from '@hapi/hapi';

const server = Hapi.server({
  port: 3000,
  host: 'localhost',
});

await server.start();
console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
```

:::note
Refer to the Hapi documentation for more details on how to set up routes, plugins, and other features.
