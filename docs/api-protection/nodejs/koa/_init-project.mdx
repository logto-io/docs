To initialize a new Node.js project with Koa, you can follow these steps:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install koa @koa/router
```

If you are using TypeScript, remember to set up your TypeScript environment accordingly.

Then, create a basic Koa server setup:

```ts title="app.ts"
import Koa from 'koa';

const app = new Koa();

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

:::note
Refer to the Koa documentation for more details on how to set up routes, middleware, and other features.
