### Configure Logto resources & permissions \{#configure-logto-resources-permissions}

<Tabs groupId="permission-models">
  <TabItem value="global-api-resources" label="Global API resources">

    1. **Create API resource:** Go to [Console → API resources](https://cloud.logto.io/api-resources) and register your API (e.g., `https://api.yourapp.com`)
    2. **Define permissions:** Add scopes like `read:products`, `write:orders` – see [Define API resources with permissions](/authorization/role-based-access-control#define-api-resources-with-permissions)
    3. **Create global roles:** Go to [Console → Roles](https://cloud.logto.io/roles) and create roles that include your API permissions – see [Configure global roles](/authorization/role-based-access-control#configure-global-roles)
    4. **Assign roles:** Assign roles to users or M2M applications that need API access

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="organization-permissions" label="Organization (non-API) permissions">

    1. **Define organization permissions:** Create non-API organization permissions like `invite:member`, `manage:billing` in the organization template
    2. **Set up organization roles:** Configure the organization template with organization-specific roles and assign permissions to them
    3. **Assign organization roles:** Assign users to organization roles within each organization context

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="organization-level-api-resources" label="Organization-level API resources">

    1. **Create API resource:** Register your API resource as above, but it will be used in organization context
    2. **Define permissions:** Add scopes like `read:data`, `write:settings` that are scoped to organization context
    3. **Configure organization template:** Set up organization roles that include your API resource permissions
    4. **Assign organization roles:** Assign users or M2M applications to organization roles that include API permissions
    5. **Multi-tenant setup:** Ensure your API can handle organization-scoped data and validation

### Update your client application \{#update-your-client-application}

**Request appropriate scopes in your client:**

- User authentication: [Update your app →](/quick-starts) to request your API scopes and/or organization context
- Machine-to-machine: [Configure M2M scopes →](/quick-starts/m2m) for server-to-server access

The process usually involves updating your client configuration to include one or more of the following:

- `scope` parameter in OAuth flows
- `resource` parameter for API resource access
- `organization_id` for organization context

:::tip Before you code
Make sure the user or M2M app you are testing has been assigned proper roles or organization roles that include the necessary permissions for your API.
