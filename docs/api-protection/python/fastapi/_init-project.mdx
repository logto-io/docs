To initialize a new FastAPI project, create a directory and set up the basic structure:

```bash
mkdir your-api-name
cd your-api-name
```

Create a requirements file:

```txt title="requirements.txt"
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a basic FastAPI application:

```py title="main.py"
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello from FastAPI"}
```

Start the development server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

:::note
Refer to the FastAPI documentation for more details on how to set up path operations, dependency injection, and other features.
