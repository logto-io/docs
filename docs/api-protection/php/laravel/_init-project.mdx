To initialize a new Laravel project, you can use the Laravel installer or Composer:

Using Laravel installer (recommended):

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
laravel new your-api-name
cd your-api-name
```

Or using Composer directly:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel your-api-name
cd your-api-name
```

Start the development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

This will create a basic Laravel project structure. For API development, you might want to remove some web-specific middleware and routes:

```php title="bootstrap/app.php"
<?php

use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Exceptions;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;

return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    ->withRouting(
        web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',
        api: __DIR__.'/../routes/api.php',
        commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
        health: '/up',
    )
    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
        // Configure API middleware as needed
    })
    ->withExceptions(function (Exceptions $exceptions) {
        //
    })->create();
```

:::note
Refer to the Laravel documentation for more details on how to set up controllers, middleware, and other features.
