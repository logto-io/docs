# Social connectors

Simplify user onboarding and increase conversion rates by enabling [social login](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/social-sign-in) with Logto. Users can quickly and securely sign in using their existing social media accounts, eliminating the need for password creation or complex registration flow. Logto offers a variety of pre-built social connectors and supports custom integrations for maximum flexibility.

### Customize your social connectors \{#customize-your-social-connectors}

For custom requirements, utilize OAuth 2.0 and OIDC (OpenID Connect) standards to integrate your preferred provider.

```mdx-code-block
<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'OAuth 2.0',
      href: '/integrations/oauth2',
      description: 'The official Logto connector for OAuth 2.0 protocol.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <OAuth2 />,
      }
    },
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'OIDC',
      href: '/integrations/oidc',
      description: 'The official Logto connector for OAuth 2.0 protocol.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <OIDC />,
      }
    },
  ]}
/>
```

If our standard connectors don't meet your specific requirements, don't hesitate to [contact us](https://logto.productlane.com/roadmap). For OSS users, you can [implement your connector (OSS)](/logto-oss/develop-your-connector/implement-connectors#build-a-social-connector) if the requirement is in urgent. We always welcome [contributions](/logto-oss/contribution); your effort could very well help other community members with the same needs.

## Configuration steps \{#configuration-steps}

1. Navigate to <CloudLink to="/connectors/social">Console > Connectors > Social Connectors</CloudLink>.
2. Click "Add social connector" and select the desired type.
3. Follow the README guide and complete required fields and customize settings.
4. Click "Save and Done" to finish.
5. Test the connector by initiating a social sign-in.

Please note the following settings:

- **Identity provider name**: Each social connector has a unique Identity Provider (IdP) name to differentiate user identities. While common connectors use a fixed IdP name, custom connectors require a unique value. Learn more about [IdP names](/connectors/connector-data-structure#target-identity-provider-name) for more details.
- **Sync user profiles**: Choose when to synchronize [user profile information](/user-management/user-data#social-identities) (e.g., avatar, username). The default is to "sync only upon registration". "sync at each sign-in" is an alternative but may overwrite custom user data.

## Enable social sign-in \{#enable-social-sign-in}

Once you create a social connector successfully, you can enable it as a Social login button (e.g., Continue with Google) in Sign-in Experience.

1. Navigate to <CloudLink to="/sign-in-experience/sign-up-and-sign-in">Console > Sign-in experience >Sign-up and sign-in</CloudLink>.
2. (Optional) Choose "Not applicable" for sign-up identifier if you need social login only.
3. Add configured social connectors to the "Social sign-in" section.
4. Reorder connectors as needed.
5. Click "Save changes" and test the "Live preview".

Refer to [Social sign-in](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/social-sign-in) to learn about the details.
