# Connector data structure

## Introduction

### What is a connector?

_Connectors_ play a critical role in Logto. With their help, Logto enables end-users to use passwordless registration or sign-in and the capabilities of signing in with social accounts. With the increasing popularity of websites and applications, passwordless and social sign-ins allow users to avoid managing numerous accounts and passwords.

Follow our [connector guides](/connectors) if you want to set up an existing connector. If you cannot find the connector you want to set up, you may develop those connectors by following the guides in [developer your connector](/logto-oss/develop-your-connector).

## Compositions

There are lots of properties in connector data.

To make the data loading and updating more efficient, we store part of connector data which will be modified frequently to DB and the rest of that locally.

- _Local storage_, also known as [_ConnectorMetadata_](./#connectors-remote-storage-connector-db), is an object containing fixed properties such as logo, connector type, and so on. (:face_with_monocle: Having trouble understanding these properties? No worry, a detailed explanation comes later!)
- _Remote storage_ is stored in DB for the sake of relatively frequent changes on those data.

## Connector's local storage: _ConnectorMetadata_

### id

_id_ is an _unique_ string-typed key to identify a connector in Logto.

It's assigned by the developers of each connector and will be uploaded to DB.

### target (Identity provider name)

_target_ is a lowercase string to distinguish the social identities source of the social connector.

Logto users can regard this variable as "Identity provider name" for better understanding.

For example, your _target_ should be _google_ if you sign in to Logto with your google account. The value of _target_ can be an arbitrary non-empty string, but we encourage you to keep it straightforward since you can not change it. We DO NOT allow the existence of multiple connectors with the same _target_ and platform. On the other hand, you can have social connectors for different platforms sharing the same _target_. For example, if users want to log in via _WeChat_ on their phone, a native _WeChat_ app is required per _WeChat_’s TOU; at the same time, a web _WeChat_ app is also needed to enable log in to web applications. These two _WeChat_ apps share the same identity provider and should have the same target.

We have concluded different use cases and suggestions for users since _target_ is a complicated concept.

### type

_type_ is the property that record the type of the connector.

We define the connectors into three different types, based on their functionalities:

- _Social_: Connectors that can access user information from arbitrary third-party social media with end-users authorization.
- _SMS_: Connectors enable end-users to receive text messages on their phones.
- _Email_: Connectors that can help send emails to end-users.

### platform

_platform_ is used to identify which platform the connector is built for.

_platform_ should be either `null` or one of the following string-typed values:

- _Native_: Connectors that ONLY work for native mobile apps.
- _Web_: Connectors work ONLY on desktop web applications.
- _Universal_: Connectors can work on both mobile web apps and desktop web apps.

:::note
_platform_ of _email connectors_ and _SMS connectors_ should always be `null`.<br/>
ONLY _social connectors_ can have non-NULL _platform_ values.
:::

### name

_name_ is an object whose keys are i18n country codes and values are connectors' display name.

### description

_description_ is also an object whose keys are i18n country codes and values are brief connector descriptions.

:::note
To support i18n display at the client-side, we store the _name_ (as well as _description_) props as a map, which uses country codes as its' key, name (or description) in local characters as the value.
:::

### logo

_logo_ is an URL or relative path of connector's logo.

### logoDark

_logoDark_ is a _nullable_ URL or relative path of connector's dark mode logo.

:::note
_logo_ is always required, and _logoDark_ is optional.

We display _logo_ in light mode and _logoDark_ in dark mode if it exists. Otherwise will fall back to show _logo_ in dark mode.
:::

### isStandard

_isStandard_ is an OPTIONAL boolean attribute to identify whether the social connector is a "standard" connector. You can identify a "standard" connector by its truthy `isStandard` attribute.

:::note
Logto only supports "standard" social connectors. That is to say, all Logto's Email or SMS connectors are NOT "standard".

Logto call connectors built upon open and standard protocols (e.g., OAuth, OIDC, SAML, etc.) as "standard" connectors. Logto's users are expected to construct multiple instances on each standard connector based on this context. For example, suppose that Logto has already provided an OAuth standard connector, users can build "OAuth GitHub connector", "OAuth Google connector" and "OAuth Facebook connector" instances. They are all based on the Logto OAuth standard connector.

If you are familiar with Logto's connector design, at most ONE Email or SMS connector can exist at the same time, which means Logto do not need "standard" Email or SMS connectors at the current stage.
:::

### readme

_readme_ is a relative path of the connector's README markdown file whose contexts will show up in "Admin Console" during connectors' set-up.

### configTemplate

_configTemplate_ is a relative path of the connector's configuration example.

## Connector's remote storage: _Connector DB_

### id

_id_, which functions as connector DB's primary key, is an randomly generated string-typed key to identify connector in DB.

### connectorId

_connectorId_ is a string-typed key and is the ONLY bridge to align _Connector DB_ and _ConnectorMetadata_. For each matched connector DB data and connector code module pair, _connectorId_ always equals to [metadata._id_](#id) of the code module.

### metadata

_metadata_ is a subset of [ConnectorMetadata](#connectors-local-storage-connectormetadata), which contains configurable attributes i.e. [_logo_](#logo), [_logoDark_](#logodark), [_target_](#target) and [_name_](#name).

### syncProfile

_syncProfile_ is a boolean value to determine the user profile updating scheme, default to be FALSE.

If _syncProfile_ is FALSE, the Logto user's basic information (including name and avatar) will be updated only when the user first signs up to Logto via this connector. Otherwise, every time users sign in to Logto through the connector, the Logto account profile will be updated.

### config

_config_ could be an arbitrary non-empty object.

It is where a connector store its configuration. Each connector have different properties in _config_ and it obligated to be valid (connectors have different standard for "valid".) before being saved to DB. ONLY those _config_ passed validity check can be updated to DB, or there would throw an error.

Developers are required to implement a _config_ guard when developing their own connectors, see [develop your connector](/logto-oss/develop-your-connector) for more details.

Want to have a glance at _config_ samples? Go to [connectors](/connectors) or each connector's settings page.

:::note
In current Logto version, only one _Email/SMS_ connector can exist at the same time, all other connectors with same type are automatically deleted.

The rule, unique working Email or SMS connector, is not applicable to _Social_ connectors.<br/>
In other words, you can add multiple _Social_ connectors.
:::

### createdAt

_createdAt_ is an auto-generated timestamp string to track the time when a connector is created in DB.
