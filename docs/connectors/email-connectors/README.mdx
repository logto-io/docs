# Email connectors

An email connector integrates your email delivery service with Logto to enable secure user verification through email. Once configured, you can send [one-time passwords (OTPs)](https://auth.wiki/otp) for user [sign-up](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/sign-up), [sign-in](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/sign-in), [password reset](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/reset-password), [account linking](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/social-sign-in#account-linking), [member invitations](/end-user-flows/organization-experience/invite-organization-members) and [high-risk operation validation](/end-user-flows/security-verification).

## Choose your email connector

Logto offers three types of email connector options:

### Free Logto Email Service (Cloud only)

This built-in email service option is ideal for getting started quickly for both [testing](/logto-cloud/tenant-settings#development) and [production](/logto-cloud/tenant-settings#production). It eliminates the need for third-party integrations; and offers free, reliable email delivery. Simply customize your basic branding for the pre-designed email templates.

The Logto Email Service connector now offers branded customization capabilities, including logo, company information, and sender name.

However, while convenient, there are some limitations to be aware of — you cannot customize the sender's email address, domain, or the specific email content.

    {

      href: '/connectors/email-connectors/built-in-email-service',
      description: 'Official connector for Logto Email Service.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <LogtoEmailService />,
      }
    },
  ]}
/>
```

### Popular email providers

Connect with your preferred email service provider (ESP) using Logto's step-by-step guides.

These options allow you to fully customize your email template, sender name, etc., to best serve your branding.

We provide out-of-the-box support for the following email service providers:

```mdx-code-block
<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'AWS Direct Mail',
      href: '/integrations/aws-ses',
      description: 'The official Logto connector for AWS connector for direct mail service.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <AwsDm />,
      }
    },
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Mailgun',
      href: '/integrations/mailgun',
      description: 'The official Logto connector for Mailgun email service.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <Mailgun />,
      }
    },
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'SendGrid Email',
      href: '/integrations/sendgrid-email',
      description: 'The official Logto connector for SendGrid email service.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <SendGrid />,
      }
    },
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Aliyun Direct Mail',
      href: '/integrations/aliyun-dm',
      description: 'The official Logto connector for Aliyun connector for direct mail service.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <AliyunDm />,
      }
    },
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Postmark Mail',
      href: '/integrations/postmark',
      description: 'Logto connector for Postmark email service.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <Postmark />,
      }
    },
  ]}
/>
```

### Customize your email connector

If none of the above solutions meet your needs, you can also choose to connect to your desired email service using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

```mdx-code-block
<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'SMTP',
      href: '/integrations/smtp',
      description: 'The official Logto connector for SMTP.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <Smtp />,
      }
    },
  ]}
/>
```

If you already have your own email service and are not eligible for using an SMTP connection, we also provide a "HTTP email connector".

When it needs to send an email, it sends an API call to the configured `endpoint` to complete the email-dependent auth flow. Note that to prevent auth flow errors, the configured endpoint needs to return a 200 response after receiving the WebHook to inform Logto that it has received the notification to send the email. In this case, you need to monitor your own email service to ensure successful delivery.

```mdx-code-block
<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'HTTP email connector',
      href: '/integrations/http-email',
      description: 'The official Logto connector for HTTP email.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <Http />,
      }
    },
  ]}
/>
```

If our standard connectors don't meet your specific requirements, don't hesitate to [contact us](https://logto.productlane.com/roadmap). For OSS users, you can [implement your connector (OSS)](/logto-oss/develop-your-connector/implement-connectors#build-a-passwordless-connector) if the requirement is in urgent. We always welcome [contributions](/logto-oss/contribution); your effort could very well help other community members with the same needs.

## Configure steps

Follow the steps below to add an email connector:

1. Navigate to <CloudLink to="/connectors/passwordless">Console > Connectors > Email and SMS connectors </CloudLink>.
2. To add a new email connector, click the "Set up" button and select your desired email provider.
3. Review the README documentation and configure for your chosen provider step-by-step.
4. Click "Save and Done" to finish.

## Change email connector

You may notice that only one email connector can be added.

When you already have an email connector, you can only select "Change email connector". When performing this operation in the console, it takes effect immediately once saved, so please be sure to test your configuration before saving.

To ensure the stability of your service, Cloud users can create a [dev tenant](/logto-cloud/tenant-settings#development) for the development environment. After testing the configuration in the development environment, "migrate" the configuration to [production](/logto-cloud/tenant-settings#production), and then save the setup.

## Enable email sign-up or sign-in

Once you successfully add the email connector and complete the configuration, you can enable sign-in and sign-up configurations that rely on email + verification code, according to your business needs.

1. **Navigate to:** <CloudLink to="/sign-in-experience/sign-up-and-sign-in">Console > Sign-in experience > Sign-up and sign-in</CloudLink>
2. [**Set sign-up methods**](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/sign-up): Choose "Email address" or "Email address or phone number" as the sign-up identifier. Note: email verification is currently mandatory during sign-up.
3. [**Set sign-in methods**](/end-user-flows/sign-up-and-sign-in/sign-in): The chosen sign-up identifier automatically becomes a sign-in method. Click "Add another" for additional sign-in options.
4. **Save Changes and Test:** Click "Save changes" to implement the new sign-in experience. Remember to use the "[Live preview](/customization/live-preview)" to test the functionality.

:::warning
Because our configurations take effect immediately, deleting existing email connector can affect end-users' normal login and registration processes.

For example, if the sign-in identifier includes "email + verification code" combination, deleting the existing email connector will prevent users from receiving verification codes via email and will result in an error in the sign-in flow.

Please be aware of the potential risks when operating on connectors.

<details>
<summary>How can I restrict IP addresses for email requests in Logto email connectors?</summary>

One workaround is to use the Logto HTTP email connector.

Implement an API endpoint on your server that calls the relevant email service, and trigger this API endpoint through the Logto [HTTP email connector](/integrations/http-email). In this way, you will have complete control over the IP address of your API endpoint and can add the corresponding IP addresses to the whitelist in the email service provider's configuration.
