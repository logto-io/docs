<summary>Regarding redirect-based sign-in</summary>

1. This authentication process follows the [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) protocol, and Logto enforces strict security measures to protect user sign-in.
2. If you have multiple apps, you can use the same identity provider (Logto). Once the user signs in to one app, Logto will automatically complete the sign-in process when the user accesses another app.

To learn more about the rationale and benefits of redirect-based sign-in, see [Logto sign-in experience explained](../../docs/tutorials/get-started/sign-in-experience.mdx).
