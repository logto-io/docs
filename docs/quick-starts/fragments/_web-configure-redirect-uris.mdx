{/* This fragment combines redirect URI and post sign-out redirect URI configuration, which may be helpful for certain frameworks. */}

#### Configure redirect URIs

Switch to the application details page of Logto Console. Add a Redirect URI <code>{props.redirectUri ?? 'http://localhost:3000/callback'}</code>.

<img alt="Redirect URI in Logto Console" src={redirectUriFigure} width="600px" />

Just like signing in, users should be redirected to Logto for signing out of the shared session. Once finished, it would be great to redirect the user back to your website. For example, add `http://localhost:3000` as the post sign-out redirect URI section.

Then click "Save" to save the changes.
