### Configure redirect URIs

Switch to the application details page of Logto Console. Add a Redirect URI `http://localhost:3000/callback`.

[Redirect URI](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/redirect-uris/) is an OAuth 2.0 concept which implies the location should redirect after authentication.

Similarly, add `http://localhost:3000/` to the "Post sign-out redirect URI" section.

[Post Sign-outRedirect URI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html#RPLogout) is an OAuth 2.0 concept which implies the location should redirect after signing out.

Then click "Save" to save the changes.
