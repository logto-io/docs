You can use these Logto methods to retrieve user information programmatically:

- <code>{props.getIdTokenClaimsApi}</code>: Get user information by decoding the local ID token.
  Some claims may not be available.
- <code>{props.fetchUserInfoApi}</code>: Fetch user information by sending a request to the
  [userinfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo).

It's important to note that the user information claims that can be retrieved depending on the
scopes used by the user during signing-in, and considering performance and data size, the ID token
may not contain all user claims, some user claims are only available in the userinfo endpoint (see
the related list below).
