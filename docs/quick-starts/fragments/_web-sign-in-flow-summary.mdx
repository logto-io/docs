Before we dive into the details, here's a quick overview of the end-user experience. The sign-in process can be simplified as follows:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A(Your app) -->|1. Invoke sign-in| B(Logto)
    B -->|2. Finish sign-in| A
```

1. Your app invokes the sign-in method.
2. The user is redirected to the Logto sign-in page. For native apps, the system browser is opened.
3. The user signs in and is redirected back to your app (configured as the redirect URI).

Regarding redirect-based sign-in:

1. This authentication process follows the [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) protocol, and Logto enforces strict security measures to protect user sign-in.
2. If you have multiple apps, you can use the same identity provider (Logto). Once the user signs in to one app, Logto will automatically complete the sign-in process when the user accesses another app.

To learn more about the rationale and benefits of redirect-based sign-in, see [Logto sign-in experience explained](../../docs/tutorials/get-started/sign-in-experience.mdx).
