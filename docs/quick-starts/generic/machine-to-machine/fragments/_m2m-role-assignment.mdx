import AssignM2mRolesModal from '../assets/assign-m2m-roles-modal.png';
import AssignM2mRolesPage from '../assets/assign-m2m-roles-page.png';

During the M2M app creation process, youâ€™ll be directed to a page where you can assign M2M roles to your applications:

<img alt="Assign M2M roles modal" src={AssignM2mRolesModal} width="600px" />

Or you can also assign these roles on the M2M app detail page when you already have an M2M app created:

<img alt="Assign M2M roles page" src={AssignM2mRolesPage} width="600px" />
