During the M2M app creation process, youâ€™ll be directed to a page where you can assign [M2M roles](/authorization/role-based-access-control/configure-roles#define-role-type) to your applications:

<img alt="Assign M2M roles modal" src="/img/assets/assign-m2m-roles-modal.png" width="600px" />

Or you can also assign these roles on the M2M app detail page when you already have an M2M app created:

<img alt="Assign M2M roles page" src="/img/assets/assign-m2m-roles-page.png" width="600px" />
