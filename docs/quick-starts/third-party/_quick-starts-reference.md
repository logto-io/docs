Under the hood, a third-party app is just a standard OAuth 2.0 / OIDC client. This means you (or the third-party developer) can use any OAuth 2.0 / OIDC library or framework to integrate with Logto.

If you're not familiar with OAuth 2.0 or OIDC, you can start by following one of our quick start guides based on your application type.

A few things to keep in mind:

1. Most of our quick start guides are written for first-party apps, but you can still use them as a reference for third-party app integration.
2. The main difference is that third-party apps will show a consent screen, asking users for explicit permission to access their data.

You can find more information in our [quick start guides](/quick-starts).
