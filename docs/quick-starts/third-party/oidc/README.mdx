# Integrate third-party app with OIDC / OAuth

Use Logto as your identity provider (IdP) to integrate third-party apps via OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth 2.0 protocol.

## Create a third-party OIDC application in Logto \{#create-a-third-party-oidc-application-in-logto}

Just like how you create a first-party application in Logto, you can also create an application for third-party services that support OIDC. This application will act as an IdP for your third-party applications.

1. Go to <CloudLink to="/applications">Console > Applications</CloudLink>.

2. Select "Third-party app".

   - If this is the first time you create an application, click on the **View all** link to see all application types.
   - Otherwise, click on the **Create application** button on the top right corner of the page and select "Third-party app".

3. Select an application type based on the third-party application's type:

   - **Traditional Web**: Server-side applications that can securely store a client secret.
   - **Single Page App (SPA)**: Browser-based applications that use PKCE for authorization.
   - **Native**: Mobile or desktop applications that use PKCE for authorization.

4. Enter a **name** and **description** for your application and click on the **Create** button. A new third-party OIDC application will be created.

## Set up the integration \{#set-up-the-integration}

After creating the application, follow the [Integration guide](/integrate-logto/third-party-applications#integration-guide) to complete the setup. The guide covers:

- Finding your application configurations (Client ID, Client secret, endpoints)
- Integrating with services that support third-party IdP
- Integrating via OAuth / OIDC protocol (with code examples for different app types)

## Manage your third-party applications \{#manage-your-third-party-applications}

All third-party applications will be catalogued on the **Applications** page, specifically under the **Third-party apps** tab. This arrangement distinguishes them from first-party applications for you, ensuring easy management.
