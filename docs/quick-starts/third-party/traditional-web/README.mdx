# Third-party app integration: Traditional web app

Use Logto as your identity provider (IdP) to integrate third-party traditional web applications via OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth 2.0 protocol.

Traditional web apps are server-side applications that can securely store client secrets. This is the most common type for third-party integrations, such as enterprise SaaS platforms or partner portals.

## Create a third-party traditional web app in Logto \{#create-a-third-party-traditional-web-app-in-logto}

1. Go to <CloudLink to="/applications">Console > Applications</CloudLink>.

2. Select "Third-party app > Third-party app (Traditional web)" as the application type.

   - If this is the first time you create an application, click on the **Third-party app** tab to see all application types.

   - Otherwise, click on the **Create application** button on the top right corner of the page and select "Third-party app > Third-party app (Traditional web)" as the application type.

3. Enter a **name** and **description** for your application and click on the **Create** button. A new third-party traditional web application will be created.

## Set up the OIDC / OAuth configurations \{#set-up-the-oidc-oauth-configurations}

To configure Logto as an IdP for your third-party traditional web application:

1. Provide the **redirect URI** of your third-party application. This is the URL that the third-party application will redirect users to after they are authenticated by Logto. You can usually find this information in the third-party application's IdP connection settings page. Logto supports multiple redirect URIs—click the **Add another** button to add more.

2. Retrieve the **client ID** and **client secret** from Logto application details page and enter them into your service provider's IdP connection settings page. Since traditional web apps run on the server side, they can securely store the client secret.

3. Retrieve the **authorization endpoint** and **token endpoint** from Logto application details page and provide them to your service provider.

   - If your service provider supports OIDC discovery, you can simply copy the **discovery endpoint** from Logto application details page and provide it to your service provider. The service provider will automatically retrieve all OIDC authentication information from the discovery endpoint.
   - Otherwise, click on the **Show endpoint details** button to view all the OIDC authentication endpoints.

## Manage permissions and branding \{#manage-permissions-and-branding}

Once the OIDC configurations are set up, you can manage what permissions the third-party application can request and customize the branding of the consent screen:

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Permission management',
      href: '/integrate-logto/third-party-applications/permission-management',
      description: 'Learn how to manage permissions for your OIDC third-party application.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <AuthorizationIcon width={20} height={20} />,
      },
    },
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Consent screen branding',
      href: '/integrate-logto/third-party-applications/consent-screen-branding',
      description:
        'Personalize the consent screen appearance to match your brand identity and provide a consistent user experience.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <CustomizationIcon width={20} height={20} />,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## Manage your third-party applications \{#manage-your-third-party-applications}

All third-party applications are listed on the **Applications** page under the **Third-party apps** tab, making it easy to distinguish them from first-party applications.
