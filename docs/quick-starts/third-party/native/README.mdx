# Third-party app integration: Native app

Use Logto as your identity provider (IdP) to integrate third-party native applications (mobile or desktop) via OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth 2.0 protocol.

Native apps are mobile or desktop applications that run on user devices. Since they cannot securely store client secrets, they use [PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)](https://auth.wiki/pkce) for secure authorization. Examples include desktop applications like Claude Desktop or VS Code that need to authenticate users to access third-party services.

## Create a third-party native app in Logto \{#create-a-third-party-native-app-in-logto}

1. Go to <CloudLink to="/applications">Console > Applications</CloudLink>.

2. Select "Third-party app > Third-party app (Native app)" as the application type.

   - If this is the first time you create an application, click on the **View all** link to see all application types.

   - Otherwise, click on the **Create application** button on the top right corner of the page and select "Third-party app > Third-party app (Native app)" as the application type.

3. Enter a **name** and **description** for your application and click on the **Create** button. A new third-party native app will be created.

## Set up the OIDC / OAuth configurations \{#set-up-the-oidc-oauth-configurations}

To configure Logto as an IdP for your third-party native application:

1. Provide the **redirect URI** of your third-party application. For native apps, this is typically a custom URL scheme (e.g., `myapp://callback`) or a universal/app link. You can usually find this information in the third-party application's IdP connection settings page. Logto supports multiple redirect URIs—click the **Add another** button to add more.

2. Retrieve the **client ID** from Logto application details page and enter it into your service provider's IdP connection settings page.

3. Retrieve the **authorization endpoint** and **token endpoint** from Logto application details page and provide them to your service provider.

   - If your service provider supports OIDC discovery, you can simply copy the **discovery endpoint** from Logto application details page and provide it to your service provider. The service provider will automatically retrieve all OIDC authentication information from the discovery endpoint.
   - Otherwise, click on the **Show endpoint details** button to view all the OIDC authentication endpoints.

4. Ensure the third-party application is configured to use **PKCE** (Proof Key for Code Exchange) during the authorization flow. Most modern OAuth/OIDC libraries support PKCE out of the box.

## Manage permissions and branding \{#manage-permissions-and-branding}

Once the OIDC configurations are set up, you can manage what permissions the third-party application can request and customize the branding of the consent screen:

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Permission management',
      href: '/integrate-logto/third-party-applications/permission-management',
      description: 'Learn how to manage permissions for your OIDC third-party application.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <AuthorizationIcon width={20} height={20} />,
      },
    },
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Consent screen branding',
      href: '/integrate-logto/third-party-applications/consent-screen-branding',
      description:
        'Personalize the consent screen appearance to match your brand identity and provide a consistent user experience.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <CustomizationIcon width={20} height={20} />,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## Manage your third-party applications \{#manage-your-third-party-applications}

All third-party applications are listed on the **Applications** page under the **Third-party apps** tab, making it easy to distinguish them from first-party applications.
