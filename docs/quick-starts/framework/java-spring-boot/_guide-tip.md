- You may find the sample code for this guide in our [spring-boot-sample](https://github.com/logto-io/spring-boot-sample) github repository.
- No official SDK is required to integrate Logto with your Java Spring Boot application. We will use the [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) and [Spring Security OAuth2](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2) libraries to handle the OIDC authentication flow with Logto.
