# Add authentication to your Java Spring Boot application

This guide will show you how to integrate Logto into your Java Spring Boot application.

<GuideTip />

## Prerequisites \{#prerequisites}

- A [Logto Cloud](https://cloud.logto.io) account or a [self-hosted Logto](/introduction/set-up-logto-oss).
- Our sample code was created using the Spring Boot [securing web starter](https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web). Following the instructions to bootstrap a new web application if you don't have one.
- In this guide, we will use the [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) and [Spring Security OAuth2](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2) libraries to handle OIDC authentication flow with Logto. Please make sure to go through the official documentation to understand the concepts.
