### Configure the plugin \{#configure-the-plugin}

Now you should be able to see the Logto menu in your WordPress admin panel sidebar. Click **Logto** > **Settings** to configure the plugin.

:::note
You should have a **traditional web** application created in Logto Console before configuring the plugin. If you haven't created one, please refer to [Integrate Logto into your application](/integrate-logto/integrate-logto-into-your-application) for more information.
:::

The minimum configuration to get started for the plugin is:

- Logto endpoint: The endpoint of your Logto tenant.
- App ID: The app ID of your Logto application.
- App secret: One of the valid app secrets of your Logto application.

All values can be found on the application details page in Logto Console.

After filling in the values, click **Save Changes** (scroll down to the bottom of the page if you can't find the button).

### Configure redirect URI \{#configure-redirect-uri}

The redirect URI is the URL to which Logto will redirect users after they have authenticated; and the post sign-out redirect URI is the URL to which Logto will redirect users after they have logged out.

Here's a non-normative sequence diagram to illustrate the sign-in flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant WordPress
    participant Logto

    User->>WordPress: Visit WordPress login page
    WordPress->>Logto: Redirect to Logto for authentication
    Logto->>User: Prompt for authentication
    User->>Logto: Authenticate
    Logto->>WordPress: Redirect back to WordPress with authentication data
    WordPress->>User: Logged in
```

Here's how the sign-out flow looks like in a non-normative sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant WordPress
    participant Logto

    User->>WordPress: Click "Log out"
    WordPress->>Logto: Redirect to Logto for sign-out
    Logto->>Logto: Sign-out successful
    Logto->>WordPress: Redirect back to WordPress
    WordPress->>User: Logged out
```

To learn more about why redirect is needed, see [Sign-in experience explained](/concepts/sign-in-experience).

In our case, we need to configure both redirect URIs in your Logto Console. To find the redirect URI, go to the **Logto** > **Settings** page in your WordPress admin panel. You'll see the **Redirect URI** and **Post sign-out redirect URI** fields.

1. Copy the **Redirect URI** and **Post sign-out redirect URI** values and paste them into the **Redirect URIs** and **Post sign-out redirect URIs** fields in your Logto Console.
2. Click **Save changes** in Logto Console.

### Checkpoint: Test your WordPress website \{#checkpoint-test-your-website}

Now you can test your Logto integration in your WordPress website:

1. Open an incognito browser window if needed.
2. Visit your WordPress website and click the **Log in** link if applicable; or directly visit the login page (e.g., `https://example.com/wp-login.php`).
3. The page should redirect you to the Logto sign-in page.
4. Complete the sign-in or sign-up process.
5. After successful authentication, you should be redirected back to your WordPress website and logged in automatically.
6. Click the **Log out** link to log out of your WordPress website.
7. You should be redirected to the Logto sign-out page, then back to your WordPress website.
8. You should be logged out of your WordPress website.
