In Logto SDK, generally we can use `logtoClient.isAuthenticated()` method to check the authentication status, if the user is signed in, the value will be `true`; otherwise, it will be `false`.

In your Webflow site, you can also use it to programmatically show and hide the sign-in and sign-out buttons. Apply the following custom code to adjust button CSS accordingly.

```js
const isAuthenticated = await logtoClient.isAuthenticated();

signInButton.style.display = isAuthenticated ? 'none' : 'block';
signOutButton.style.display = isAuthenticated ? 'block' : 'none';
```
