# WordPress guide

This tutorial will show you how to integrate Logto into your [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) website.

## Prerequisites

- A [Logto Cloud](https://cloud.logto.io) account or a self-hosted Logto (Check out the [⚡ Get started](../../../docs/get-started/) guide to create one if you don't have).
- A Logto traditional application created.
- A WordPress project: follow the official [Wordpress installation guide](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/) to set up your Wordpress website before proceeding.

## Integration

### Install the plugin

We will use the [OpenID Connect Generic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/generic-openid-connect/) plugin to integrate Logto via OIDC protocal into your Wordpress website.

1. Log in to your WordPress site.
2. Navigate to "Plugins" and click "Add New".
3. Search for "OpenID Connect Generic" and install the plugin by daggerhart.
4. Activate the plugin.

### Configure redirect URI

First, let’s configure the redirect URI. You can find it in the plugin settings, scroll down to the "Notes" section, and copy the "Redirect URI" value.

Switch to the Application details page of Logto Console. Add a Redirect URI, and click "Save changes".

### Set up the plugin

Refer to the following table for the necessary configuration details:

### Checkpoint: Test your application

Now, you can test your application:

1. Log out of your WordPress site.
2. Visit the WordPress login page and click the "Sign in with Logto" button.
3. You will be redirected to the Logto sign-in page.
4. Sign in with your Logto account.
5. You will be redirected back to the WordPress site and logged in automatically.

## Roles mapping

WordPress has a built-in user role management system that defines what actions (capabilities) a user can perform on a site. The default user roles include Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, and Subscriber, each with its own set of capabilities.

Logto employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) as its authorization model, utilizing "scopes" as the smallest unit of permission. These scopes define the specific actions that an authenticated user is allowed to perform within an application. However, WordPress operates on a different principle for managing user permissions, relying on predefined "roles" that bundle various capabilities together.

Given this fundamental difference, we suggest creating special roles within Logto that correspond to the roles defined in WordPress. Thoes roles may not have any scopes, they are only used as a reference for mapping users to WordPress roles.

### Prerequisites

- Setup roles in Logto that correspond to the roles in WordPress. For example, if you have an 'editor' role in WordPress, create a 'group:editors' role in Logto.

### Implement role mapping

To implement role mapping, we will add custom code to the WordPress theme's `functions.php` file. This involves using the `wp_login` action hook, which triggers when a user logs in. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set this up:

### Step 1: access your theme's functions.php

Open your theme’s `functions.php` file. You can access this file through the WordPress admin panel by navigating to Appearance > Theme Editor and selecting `functions.php` from the right-hand side files list. Or in the source code, navigate to your WordPress theme directory and locate the `functions.php` file. This file allows you to add custom PHP functions that extend the functionality of your WordPress site.

### Step 2: write the role mapping function

Below is a simple example of a function that you might add to functions.php. This function will be triggered upon user login, and it will assign roles based on the user's `roles` claim fetched from Logto.

```php
function logto_handler($user_login, $user = null) {
	if (!$user) {
		$user = get_user_by('login', $user_login);
	}

	$oidc_claims = get_user_meta($user->ID, 'openid-connect-generic-last-user-claim', true);

	if (in_array('group:editors', $oidc_claims['roles'])) {
		$user->set_role('editor');
	} else {
		$user->set_role('subscriber');
	}
}

add_action('wp_login', 'logto_handler', 10, 2);
```

### Step 3: understanding the code and customizing it

- `logto_handler` function: This function takes two parameters: `$user_login` (username) and `$user` (user object). It retrieves roles from Logto which stored in user meta as `openid-connect-generic-last-user-claim`, maps this role to a corresponding WordPress role, and assigns it to the user.

- `add_action`: This line hooks the `logto_handler` function to the `wp_login` action, which is triggered after a user logs in. The `10` is the priority (default), and `2` indicates the number of arguments the function accepts.

The example above assigns the 'editor' role to users authenticated via Logto with role name `group:editors`. However, in a real-world scenario, you'll likely need to implement more kinds of role mappings.

You can find the list of WordPress roles and their capabilities [here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/).

### Step 4: test your setup

Now, let's test the role mapping function by logging in with a user that has the `group:editors` role in Logto. After logging in, check the user's role in WordPress to ensure that the mapping is working correctly.
