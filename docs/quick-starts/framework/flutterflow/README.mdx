# Customize the FlutterFlow CustomAuthManager using Logto SDK

FlutterFlow has a built-in [custom authentication](https://docs.flutterflow.io/data-and-backend/custom-authentication) feature that allows you to authenticate users using your own backend. However, the build-in custom authentication flow was designed to work with a single authentication API call. If you are using a third-party Identity Provider (IdP) the authentication request can only be done using the `Resource Owner Password Credentials` grant type, which is not recommended for production use. See [Deprecated ropc grant type](https://blog.logto.io/deprecated-ropc-grant-type/) for more details.

A standard OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication flow involves multiple steps, such as authorization, token exchange, and user information retrieval. To implement a standard OIDC authentication flow with a IdP like Logto, you need to customize the `CustomAuthManager` class in FlutterFlow.

This tutorial will show you how to customize the `CustomAuthManager` class in FlutterFlow using Logto [Flutter SDK](../flutter/README.mdx). You may take advantage of the Logto SDK for the standard OIDC authentication flow while keeping the benefits of the FlutterFlow UI builder.

:::tip

- Logto SDK package is available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/logto_dart_sdk) and Logto [github repository](https://github.com/logto-io/dart).
- The SDK is currently only suitable for Android and iOS platforms.

:::

## Prerequisites

- A [Logto Cloud](https://cloud.logto.io) account or a self-hosted Logto (Check out the [âš¡ Get started](../../../docs/tutorials/get-started/) guide to create one if you don't have).
- Create a Logto Flutter application.
- A FlutterFlow project.

## Enable FlutterFlow custom code

In order to customize the `CustomAuthManager` class, you need to enable the custom code feature in FlutterFlow. Following the [Manage Custom Code In GitHub](https://docs.flutterflow.io/customizing-your-app/manage-custom-code-in-github) guide to sync your FlutterFlow project with GitHub.

:::note
Manage custom code in GitHub is a premium feature in FlutterFlow. You need to upgrade your FlutterFlow to pro plan to enable this feature.
:::

Once it is done, you will have three different branches under your GitHub FlutterFlow repository:

1. `main`: The main branch for the flutter project. You will need this branch to deploy your project.
2. `flutterflow`: The branch where the `FlutterFlow` will sync the changes from the FlutterFlow editor.
3. `develop`: The branch where you can modify your custom code.

## Create your UI in FlutterFlow

First, create your UI in FlutterFlow. You can follow the [FlutterFlow documentation](https://docs.flutterflow.io/) to create your UI based on your requirements. For this tutorial, for the minimum requirement, we will create two pages:

1. A simple home page with a login button.
2. A user profile page to display user information and logout button.

Got to the `App Settings` -> `Authentication` page and enable the custom authentication. This will create a `CustomAuthManager` class in your FlutterFlow project.

<center>
  <img src={flutterFlowCustomAuth} alt="FlutterFlow custom authentication" />
</center>

Once you have the UI ready, navigate to the `integrations` -> `GitHub` page and click on the `Push to Repository` button to push the changes to the `flutterflow` branch.

<center>
  <img src={flutterFlowGitHub} alt="FlutterFlow GitHub push" />
</center>

## Customize the CustomAuthManager

Switch to the `develop` branch in your GitHub repository and merge the latest changes from the `flutterflow` branch. Including your UI pages, and the pre built `CustomAuthManager` class.

### Install Logto SDK dependency

Add the Logto SDK dependency to your project.

```bash
  flutter pub add logto_dart_sdk
```

:::note
Optional Http package:

Logto client requires a http client to make API calls. You can use the `http` package or any other http client package of your choice.

```bash
  flutter pub add http
```

:::

### Update the UserProvider

Add the `OpenIdClaims` class to the `CustomAuthUserProvider` class to store the user information.

> `OpenIdClaims` class is a part of the Logto SDK, which will provide the `id_token` claims for the authenticated user.

<AuthUserProviderCode />

### Init the logto client in CustomAuthManager

Initialize the Logto client in the `CustomAuthManager` class.

<InitCustomAuthManagerCode />

The `initialize` method will initialize the Logto client and update the current user stream with the user authentication status persisted in the local storage.

> Logto SDK uses the [flutter_secure_storage](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage) package to store the user authentication information securely.

### Implement the Sign-in method

Call the `LogtoClient.signIn` method will initiate a standard OIDC authentication flow. The Logto Sign-In page will be opened in a webview using [flutter_web_auth](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_web_auth).

```dart
// lib/auth/custom_auth/custom_auth_manager.dart

Future<FlutterFlowAuthAuthUser?> signIn(
    String redirectUri,
  ) async {
    await logtoClient.signIn(redirectUri);

    var idTokenClaims = await logtoClient.idTokenClaims;

    return _updateCurrentUser(
      loggedIn: idTokenClaims != null,
      uid: idTokenClaims?.subject,
      idToken: idTokenClaims,
    );
  }

```

LogtoClient will handle the authorization, token exchange, and user information retrieval steps. Once the user is authenticated, the `idTokenClaims` will be stored in the local storage.
Retrieve the `idTokenClaims` from the LogtoClient and update the current user stream.

### Implement the Sign-out method

```dart
// lib/auth/custom_auth/custom_auth_manager.dart

Future signOut() async {
    await logtoClient.signOut();

    flutterFlowAuthAuthUserSubject.add(
      FlutterFlowAuthAuthUser(loggedIn: false),
    );
  }
```

### Update the auth util methods

- Add the `authManager` getter to access the `CustomAuthManager` instance.
- Add the `currentUserUid` getter to get the current user uid.
- Add the `currentUserData` getter to get the current user data.
- Add the `logtoClient` getter to access the Logto client instance.

```dart
// lib/auth/custom_auth/auth_util.dart

import 'package:logto_dart_sdk/logto_client.dart';
import 'package:logto_dart_sdk/src/modules/id_token.dart';

import 'custom_auth_manager.dart';

export 'custom_auth_manager.dart';

final _authManager = CustomAuthManager();
CustomAuthManager get authManager => _authManager;
String get currentUserUid => currentUser?.uid ?? '';
OpenIdClaims? get currentUserData => currentUser?.idToken;
LogtoClient get logtoClient => _authManager.logtoClient;
```

## Integrate the custom authentication in your UI

### Home Page

Call the `authManager.signIn` method to initiate the authentication flow when the user clicks on the sign-in button.

> `redirectUri` is the callback URL that will be used to capture the authorization callback from the Logto sign-in page.
> See the [Flutter SDK](../flutter/README.mdx#implement-sign-in) for more details on the redirectUri.

```dart
// lib/pages/home_page/home_page_widget.dart

final redirectUri = 'io.logto://callback';

// ...

FFButtonWidget(
  onPressed: () async {
    GoRouter.of(context).prepareAuthEvent();

    await authManager.signIn(redirectUri);

    context.replaceNamed('user');
  },
  text: 'Sign In',
  // ...
)
```

### User Profile Page

Use the auth util getters to access the current user data and the Logto client instance.

```dart
// lib/pages/user/user_widget.dart

import '/auth/custom_auth/auth_util.dart';

// ...

children: [
  Text(
    'User ID: $currentUserUid',
  ),
  Text(
    'Display Name: ${currentUserData?.name}',
  ),
  Text(
    'Username: ${currentUserData?.username}',
  ),
  Text(
    'Email: ${currentUserData?.emailVerified ?? currentUserData?.email}',
  ),
]

```

Implement the sign-out method when the user clicks on the sign-out button.

```dart
// lib/pages/user/user_widget.dart

FFButtonWidget(
  onPressed: () async {
    await authManager.signOut();

    context.replaceNamed('HomePage');
  },
  text: 'Sign Out',
  // ...
)
```
