## Troubleshooting

### Unable to resolve `@logto/client/shim`

For Expo projects, if you encounter the error `Unable to resolve "@logto/client/shim" from "node_modules/@logto/rn/lib/index.js"`, you can resolve it by adding the following to your `metro.config.js` file:

```js title="metro.config.js"
const config = {
  // ...
  resolver: {
    unstable_enablePackageExports: true,
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

This error indicates that `@logto/rn` package not being able to resolve the `@logto/client/shim` module.

As the node exports were used in the`@logto/client` package, and package exports are not enabled by default in Metro bundler, you need to enable them manually.

See the [React Native package exports support](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2023/06/21/package-exports-support#enabling-package-exports-beta) for more details.
