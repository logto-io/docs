<ApiResourcesDescription />

By default, when you access `User?.AccessToken`, you will get an opaque token which has a short length and is not a JWT (JSON Web Token). This token is used to access the userinfo endpoint.

### Add API resource to configuration

In order to get a JWT token that can be used to access an API resource defined in Logto, add the following parameters to the `appsettings.json` file (taking `https://my-api-resource` as an example):

{/* eslint-disable prettier/prettier */}
```json5
{
  // ...
  "IdentityServer": {
    // ...
    "Scope": "openid profile email <your-api-scopes>", // Add your API scopes here
    "Resource": "https://my-api-resource",
    "ExtraTokenParams": {
        "resource": "https://my-api-resource" // Ensure the key "resource" is lowercase
    }
  }
}
```
{/* eslint-enable prettier/prettier */}

The `Resource` property is used to add the API resource to the auth request. The `ExtraTokenParams` property is used to add the API resource to the token request. Since Logto conforms [RFC 8707](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8707) for API resources, both properties are required.

:::caution
Since WebAssembly is a client-side application, the token request will only be sent to the server-side once. Due to this nature, `LoadUserInfo` is conflict with fetching access token for API resources.
:::

### Use access token

Once the user is authenticated, you can access the API resource by using the `User?.AccessToken` property. For example, you can use the `HttpClient` to access the API resource:

```csharp
using Blorc.OpenIdConnect;

builder.Services
    .AddHttpClient("MyApiResource", client =>
    {
        client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://my-api-resource");
    })
    .AddAccessToken(); // Add access token to the request header
```
