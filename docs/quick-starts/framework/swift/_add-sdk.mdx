Use the following URL to add Logto SDK as a dependency in Swift Package Manager.

```bash
https://github.com/logto-io/swift.git
```

Since Xcode 11, you can [directly import a Swift package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) w/o any additional tool.

We do not support **Carthage** and **CocoaPods** at the time due to some technical issues.

<details>

<summary>Carthage</summary>

Carthage [needs a `xcodeproj` file to build](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/1226#issuecomment-290931385), but `swift package generate-xcodeproj` will report a failure since we are using binary targets
for native social plugins. We will try to find a workaround later.

<details>

<summary>CocoaPods</summary>

CocoaPods [does not support local dependency](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3276) and monorepo, thus it&apos;s hard to create a `.podspec` for this repo.
