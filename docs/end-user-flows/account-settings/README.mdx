# Account settings

Logto provides a two collection of account settings APIs to allow users to manage their account and profiles stored in Logto.

## Use Account APIs (Recommended)

LLogto’s Account APIs are ready-to-use, front-end endpoints that let end users securely view and update their own information with built-in permission checks. Simply embed them in your client application to power a polished, self-service account settings page.

Key features:

- **End-user settings**: Users manage their own sign-in identifiers and credentials, social accounts, MFA methods, and profile data.
- **Client-side integration**: Designed for safe, direct use in your front-end.
- **Minimal setup**: Turnkey endpoints without custom server required.
- **Permission control**: Toggle which Account APIs are enabled via Management API settings.

    },
  ]}
/>

## Use Management APIs

The Management APIs form Logto’s core administrative interface, accessible only to admins or back-end services. They deliver maximum flexibility and full CRUD control over every user account and allow you to build custom management tools. If you need a fully custom self-service portal or nonstandard user-management features, you can expose selected Management API endpoints behind your own “Account API” layer and secure them with your business’s auth logic.

Key features:

- **Admin-only access**: Intended for developers and back-office systems
- **Full user lifecycle**: Create, read, update, delete, suspend, or restore accounts
- **Advanced operations**: Generate personal access tokens, impersonate users, connect OAuth apps, customize workflows.
