# Account settings

Logto provides a two collection of account settings APIs to allow users to manage their account and profiles stored in Logto.

## User Management APIs

Logto Management APIs provides the most comprehensive functionality to manage users and their profile data. You may implement a self-hosted user management system or end-user account settings page using these APIs.

  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Use Logto Management APIs',
      href: '/end-user-flows/account-settings/by-management-api',
      description:
        'Learn more about how to use the user Management APIs to build your own account settings page.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <GearIcon />,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## Account APIs

Apart from the Management APIs, Logto also provides a set of end-user account APIs to allow end-users directly manage their account settings and profile data. Unlike the Management APIs, the account APIs are designed to be used in the end-user context with detailed user permission control. You can use the account APIs directly in your client-side application to build a user-friendly account settings page.

      },
    },
  ]}
