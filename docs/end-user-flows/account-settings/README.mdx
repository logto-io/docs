# Account settings

Logto provides a two collection of account settings APIs to allow users to manage their account and profiles stored in Logto.

## User Management APIs

Logto Management APIs provides the most comprehensive functionality to manage users and their profile data. You may implement a self-hosted user management system or end-user account settings page using these APIs.

## Account APIs

Apart from the Management APIs, Logto also provides a set of end-user account APIs to allow end-users directly manage their account settings and profile data. Unlike the Management APIs, the account APIs are designed to be used in the end-user context with detailed user permission control. You can use the account APIs directly in your client-side application to build a user-friendly account settings page.
