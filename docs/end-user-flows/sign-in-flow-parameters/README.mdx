# Sign-in flow parameters

In a standard OIDC sign-in flow, client applications initiate an authentication request that redirects the user to the Logto hosted universal sign-in experience web page. Based on your sign-in experience settings, users can sign in or sign up using various identifiers, verification methods and third-party social or enterprise SSO connectors.

In addition to the standard [OIDC authentication parameters](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest), our product introduces several custom sign-in flow parameters that allow you to tailor the desired sign-in experience for the end-users.

This is particularly useful when you want to enforce specific sign-in flows for different user segments. Including but not limited to the following scenarios:

1. **Direct sign-up for new users**: For a targeted registration campaign, you may want to direct new users straight to the sign-up page, bypassing the default sign-in form, to ensure a seamless onboarding experience.
2. **Email prefilled sign-up from a subscription link**: If you're collecting email addresses through a self-hosted subscription form, these parameters allow you to redirect the new subscribers to the sign-up page with email field pre-populated, making it easy for them to complete the registration process.
3. **Direct password reset link**: For new users who need to set up their new password, send them a direct link and redirect them to the password reset page with the email field prefilled.
4. **Instant social login**: If you provide social media sign-in buttons directly on your site, you can use these parameters to skip the default sign-in form and let users authenticate directly with their chosen social provider.
5. **Direct SSO sign-in for enterprise customers**: For products serving multiple enterprise clients, these parameters allow you to display a dedicated SSO button that signs in users with their specific SSO provider, skipping the universal sign-in form and providing a seamless experience for each organization.
