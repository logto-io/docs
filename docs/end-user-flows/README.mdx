# End-user flows

End-user flows cover all verification processes for user interactions, categorized as follows:

- **Sign-in experience**: Involves user sign-in, registration, and password reset. Logto offers out-of-the-box experiences configured in Console, and you can bring your UI via Experience APIs.
- **Account experience**: Involves account settings, user profile, and security verification. Use Account APIs or Management APIs to implement.
- **Organization experience**: For multi-tenancy products, like B2B or SaaS services. Involves organization creation, member invitation, and management. Use Management APIs to integrate this into your apps.
