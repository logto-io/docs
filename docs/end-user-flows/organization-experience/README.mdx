# Organization experience

The [organization](/organizations) experience is the set of UIs and flows your business customers and their employees use—especially in [multi-tenant applications](https://auth.wiki/multi-tenancy). This guide shows how to integrate it into your app using the Logto Management API.

This section helps you design the **organization experience** for your end users—for example:

1. Admins can create their own organizations.
2. Admins can manage organization members.
3. Admins can invite members to join their organizations.
4. and more.

## Understand the authentication flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor User
  participant Frontend
  participant Backend
  participant Logto

  User->>Frontend: Request to create organization
  Frontend->>Backend: POST /organizations
  Backend->>Logto: POST /api/organizations
  Logto-->>Backend: Organization created
  Backend->>Logto: POST /api/organizations/{id}/users
  Logto-->>Backend: User added to organization
  Backend-->>Frontend: Success response
  Frontend-->>User: Show success message
```

To integrate with the Logto Management API, first understand the basic authentication flow. It has two key requirements:

### Protect your backend API

- Frontend calls to your backend API require authentication.
- Protect API endpoints by validating the user's Logto access token.
- Ensure only authenticated users can access your services.

### Access the Logto Management API

- Your backend service securely calls the Logto Management API.
- Follow the [Interact with Management API](/integrate-logto/interact-with-management-api) guide for setup.
- Use machine-to-machine authentication to obtain access credentials.

The next few chapters explain how to set up the Logto Management API and walk through common use cases for building your organization experience.
