# Organization experience

[Organization](/organizations) experience refers to the user interfaces and flows used by your business clients and their employees, particularly in [multi-tenant applications](https://auth.wiki/multi-tenancy). Logto provides several guides to help you quickly integrate this experience into your app using the Logto Management API.
