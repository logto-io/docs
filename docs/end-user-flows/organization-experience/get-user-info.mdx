# Get user info within an organization

## Where to use it \{#where-to-use-it}

This is usually used in the user profile page where users need to show their organization information.

## How to implement it \{#how-to-implement-it}

There are two ways to get user info within an organization.

### Decode the ID token \{#decode-the-id-token}

The ID token is a standard JWT that contains user profile information and organization‑related claims. Call the SDK method `decodeIdToken()` to get a JSON object like this:

```json
{
  "sub": "aauqbb63vg4s",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "picture": "https://example.com/johndoe.png",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  // ...
  "organizations": [
    "organization-id-1",
    "organization-id-2",
    "organization-id-3"
    // ...
  ],
  "organization_roles": [
    "organization-id-1:admin",
    "organization-id-2:member",
    "organization-id-3:viewer"
    // ...
  ],
  "aud": "admin-console"
  // ...
}
```

However, the ID token is only issued during authentication and may become stale if the user profile changes afterward.
For the most up‑to‑date info, use the second approach below, or call `clearAllTokens()` and re‑initiate an authentication flow to get a fresh ID token.

```ts
await logtoClient.clearAllTokens();
logtoClient.signIn({
  redirectUri: 'https://your-app.com/callback',
  prompt: 'consent',
});
```

If the session is still valid, the `signIn` call will redirect back to your app without requiring credentials. From the user’s perspective, the app simply refreshes and a new ID token is issued behind the scenes.

### Fetch user info from the `/oidc/me` endpoint \{#fetch-user-info-from-the-oidc-me-endpoint}

You can also request `/oidc/me` to get real‑time user info in the organization context. Call the SDK method `fetchUserInfo()`.
