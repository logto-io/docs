# Join the organization

## Where to use it

The organization list typically appears during the user onboarding flow. For example, when an admin invites you to join a workspace.

From a product perspective, it can show up in two main places:

- The **organization finder** during sign-in or sign-up

<img
  src="/img/assets/join-organization-on-sign-in-or-sign-up.png"
  alt="Join organization during sign-in or sign-up"
/>

- The **organization switcher** within the application

<img src="/img/assets/join-organization-in-app.png" alt="Join organization within the app" />

## Use the Logto Management API to let users join an organization

In the previous section, we covered creating and sending organization invitations using the Logto Management API.
Next, implement a landing page that handles the invitation link when invitees arrive at your application.

- `GET /api/organization-invitations` and `GET /api/organization-invitations/{id}`: Get all invitations or a specific one by ID.
  On your landing page, use these APIs to list all invitations or show the details of a specific invitation the user received.
- `PUT /api/organization-invitations/{id}/status`: Accept or reject the invitation by updating its status.
  Use this API to handle the userâ€™s response.
