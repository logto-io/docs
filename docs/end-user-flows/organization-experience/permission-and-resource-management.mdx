# Permission and resource management

Use the organization as a resource and apply an organization template to protect it. For example, each organization has its own documents within a tenant. Only users with the right roles can edit or delete those documents.

See [Organization permissions](/authorization/organization-permissions) for details.

## Use organization role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions

With the above setup, you can send invitations via email, and invitees can join the organization with the assigned role.

Users with different organization roles will have different scopes (permissions) in their organization tokens. Both your client app and backend services should check these scopes to determine visible features and permitted actions.

## Handle scope updates in organization tokens

This section covers advanced topics about managing the organization template and authorization scenarios. If you’re not familiar with these concepts, read [Authorization](/authorization) and [Organization template](/authorization/organization-template) first.

Managing scope updates in organization tokens involves:

### Revoke existing scopes

For instance, demoting an admin to a non‑admin member should remove scopes from the user. In such cases, clear the cached organization token and fetch a new one with a refresh token. The reduced scopes will be reflected immediately in the newly issued organization token.

### Grant new scopes

This can be divided into two scenarios:

#### Grant new scopes that are already defined in your auth system

Similar to revoking scopes, if the newly granted scope is already registered with the auth server, issue a new organization token and the new scopes will be reflected immediately.

#### Grant new scopes that are newly introduced into your auth system

In this case, trigger a re‑login or re‑consent process to update the user’s organization token. For example, call the `signIn` method in the Logto SDK.

## Check permissions in real time and update the organization token

Logto provides a Management API to fetch real‑time user permissions in the organization.

- `GET /api/organizations/{id}/users/{userId}/scopes` ([API references](https://openapi.logto.io/operation/operation-listorganizationuserscopes))

Compare the scopes in the user’s organization token with the real‑time permissions to determine if the user has been promoted or demoted.

- If demoted, clear the cached organization token and the SDK will automatically issue a new one with the updated scopes.

  ```tsx
  const { clearAccessToken } = useLogto();

  ...
  // If fetched real-time scopes have fewer scopes than the organization token scopes
  await clearAccessToken();

  ```

  This does not require a re‑login or re‑consent process. New organization tokens will be issued automatically by the Logto SDK.

- If a new scope is introduced into your auth system, trigger a re‑login or re‑consent process to update the user’s organization token. For example, with the React SDK:

  ```tsx
  const { clearAllTokens, signIn } = useLogto();

  ...
  // If fetched real-time scopes have newly assigned scopes than the organization token scopes
  await clearAllTokens();
  signIn({
    redirectUri: '<your-sign-in-redirect-uri>',
    prompt: 'consent',
  });

  ```

  The above code triggers a navigation to the consent screen and auto‑redirects back to your app with updated scopes in the user’s organization token.
