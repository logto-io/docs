# UI locales

Logto supports the standard OIDC authentication parameter `ui_locales` to control the language of the sign-in experience and downstream communications for a given interaction.

## What it does

- Determines the UI language of the Logto-hosted sign-in experience at runtime. Logto picks the first language tag in `ui_locales` that is supported in your tenant's language library.
- Affects email localization for messages triggered by the interaction (e.g., verification code emails). See [Email template localization](/connectors/email-connectors/email-templates#email-template-localization).
- Exposes the original value to email templates as a variable `uiLocales`, allowing you to include it in the email subject/content if needed.

## Parameter format

- Name: `ui_locales`
- Type: `string`
- Value: Space-separated list of BCP 47 language tags, e.g. `fr-CA fr en`.
- Reference: [OpenID Connect Core - ui_locales](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)

## Resolution order and precedence

When determining the UI language for the sign-in experience and related emails, Logto resolves the end-user language using this order:

1. `ui_locales` from the current authentication request (first supported tag wins).
2. Otherwise, `Accept-Language` header (Experience APIs / User Account APIs) or `messagePayload.locale` (Management APIs like organization invitations).
3. Otherwise, the tenant's default language configured in Sign-in Experience.

This behavior does not permanently change your language settings; it only applies to the current interaction.

## SDK usage

If you're using a Logto SDK, pass `ui_locales` via the `extraParams` of the sign-in call so it is forwarded to the authorization request:

```ts
await logtoClient.signIn({
  redirectUri: 'https://your.app/callback',
  extraParams: {
    ui_locales: 'fr-CA fr en',
  },
});
```

## Examples

- `ui_locales=fr-CA fr en` → If `fr-CA` exists in your language library, the sign-in UI renders in French (Canada); otherwise it falls back to `fr`, then `en`.
- `ui_locales=ja` but Japanese is not enabled → Falls back to `Accept-Language` or tenant default.
