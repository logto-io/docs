# Reset password

The password recovery feature will be automatically enabled to you when you have a valid [Email connector](/connectors/email-connectors) or [SMS connector](/connectors/sms-connectors) configured. User can reset their password by providing their registered email address or phone number.

## Forgot password for account recovery

Once the reset password feature is enabled, a "Forgot password" link button will be displayed under the sign-in form. Users can click the "Forgot password" link to initiate a password reset process.

:::note
Not seeing the "Forgot password" link? Make sure you have a valid **Email** or **SMS** connector configured.
:::

1. **Visit sign-in page**: User visits the sign-in page.
2. **Click on Forgot password link**: User clicks on the "Forgot password" link.
3. **Enter email/phone**: After clicking on the "Forgot password" link, user will be redirected to a new page where they can enter their registered email address or phone number.
4. **Send verification code**: Logto will send a verification code to the user provided email address or phone number and redirect to the code verification page.
5. **Enter verification code**: User enters the verification code received in their email or phone. Logto will verify the code and identity of the user associated with the email address or phone number.
6. **Enter new password**: User will be prompted to enter a new password once the verification code is successfully verified
7. **Successful password reset:** If the provided password meets the password policy requirements, the password will be updated successfully.
8. **Redirect to sign-in page**: User will be redirected to the sign-in page to sign in with the new password

## Update password after sign-in

Authenticated users can change (or initially set) their password via your in‑app account settings experience. See [Account settings](/end-user-flows/account-settings/by-account-api#update-users-password) for how to build this with the Account API.

## Check if user has a password

User data exposes a boolean field `hasPassword` indicating whether the user currently has a password credential stored.

You can obtain `hasPassword` by:

- [Management API](/integrate-logto/interact-with-management-api): e.g. `GET /api/users/:id` (included in the user object)
- [Custom token claims](/developers/custom-token-claims): Inject `hasPassword` into ID/access tokens (so your frontend can branch UI without an extra API call)

Then call the Account API endpoint to set or update the password (see the Account settings guide for request details). For users who never had a password, you do NOT need (and should not require) the old password field.

:::tip

Even if your sign‑up methods require “Set a password” for email / phone / username registrations, users created through pure **social sign-in** skip password creation by default to reduce friction. These users will have `hasPassword = false` until they explicitly set one later. Avoid forcing immediate password setup right after social sign-up unless required by your security model—delayed, context-aware prompts usually convert better.

## Custom password policy \{#custom-password-policy}

Customize password length, character requirements, and word restrictions to meet your business's security needs while providing a good user experience. These settings can be configured in the <CloudLink to="/security/password-policy">Security > Password policy</CloudLink> section. Check the [password policy](/security/password-policy) doc to learn more.

Subscribe to the `PostResetPassword` [webhook event](/developers/webhooks/webhooks-events#user-interaction-hook-events) to receive a notification when a user successfully resets their password. You can then trigger a [sign-out](/end-user-flows/sign-out) action to invalidate the user's current session and redirect them to the sign-in page.
