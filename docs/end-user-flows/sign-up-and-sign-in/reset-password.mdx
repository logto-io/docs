# Reset password

The password recovery feature will be automatically enabled to you when you have a valid [Email connector](/connectors/email-connectors) or [SMS connector](/connectors/sms-connectors) configured. User can reset their password by providing their registered email address or phone number.

## Password reset flow

Once the reset password feature is enabled, a "Forgot password" link button will be displayed under the sign-in form. Users can click the "Forgot password" link to initiate a password reset process.

## Set up password policy

For new users or users who are updating their password, you can set a password policy to enforce password strength requirements. Visit the <CloudLink to="/sign-in-experience/password-policy"> Console > Sign-in experience > Password policy</CloudLink> to configure the password policy settings.

  <summary> How to sign-out a user after a successful password reset?</summary>

Subscribe to the `PostResetPassword` [webhook event](/developers/webhooks/webhooks-events#user-interaction-hook-events) to receive a notification when a user successfully resets their password. You can then trigger a [sign-out](/end-user-flows/sign-out) action to invalidate the user's current session and redirect them to the sign-in page.
