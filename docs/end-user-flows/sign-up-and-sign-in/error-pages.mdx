# Custom sign-in experience error pages

During the sign-in flow, end users may sometimes see default error pages. Common scenarios include:

- **Expired sessions**: The user took too long to sign in, and the session timed out.
- **Directly visiting the sign-in URL**: The user opens a bookmark or shares `/sign-in` URL (bypassing the normal sign-in button).
- **Non-existent routes**: The user navigates to a path that doesn’t exist in your auth flows.
- **Social sign-in callback issues**: The social session is not found in a social callback page.
- **Invalid magic links**: A [one-time token (magic link)](/end-user-flows/one-time-token) for things like organization invitation or passwordless sign-in has expired or consumed.

By default, Logto will show a generic error page (e.g., a 404 “unknown session” page) in these scenarios. To improve the end-user experience when encountering errors, you need to set up the following parameters:

- **Unknown session redirect URL**: A fallback URL to send users to when their session is not found.
- **Support email & Support website**: Contact information shown on error pages.

## Unknown session redirect URL \{#unknown-session-redirect-url}

Logto uses the [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://auth.wiki/openid-connect) flow for authentication. A valid OIDC authorization flow must be initiated by your application, e.g, clicking your app’s “Sign in” button sends an OIDC authorization request to Logto, which then sets up a secure session (cookie).

However, if a user directly accesses `/sign-in`, bypassing session validation, it causes "unknown session" 404 errors when:

- Sessions expire
- Users bookmark/share sign-in links
- Authorization context is missing

To handle this, Logto introduced an `unknownSessionRedirectUrl` setting. When you set this URL, Logto will automatically redirect users to the specified page to reinitiate a new sign-in flow instead of showing the 404 error.

How to set it up:

1. Go to <CloudLink to="/sign-in-experience/sign-up-and-sign-in">Console > Sign-in experience > Sign-up and sign-in > Advanced settings</CloudLink>
2. Set the "Unknown session redirect URL" to your service address or product’s homepage. E.g., Logto Cloud will set "https://cloud.logto.io".

## Support contact info \{#support-contact-info}

If other errors occur (such as visiting an invalid path, a social callback with no session, or opening an expired magic link), Logto will show a default error page. To help users, you can display contact information on these unavoidable error pages.

How to set it up:

1. Go to <CloudLink to="/sign-in-experience/content">Console > Sign-in experience > Content > Support</CloudLink>
2. Set your support email address
3. Set your support or official website URL

This ensures that even when something goes wrong, users have a clear way to get help.
