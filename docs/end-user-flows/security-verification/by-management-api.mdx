# Implement security verification by management API

## Password verification

When users attempt to change their password, the system should prompt them to re-enter their current password to verify their identity. This step ensures that only the authorized account holder can change the password, preventing unauthorized access to the account.

| POST   | [/api/users/\{userId\}/password/verify](https://openapi.logto.io/operation/operation-verifyuserpassword) | Verify current user password by user ID. |

## Email/SMS one-time code verification

Send a verification code to the user’s email or phone number and prompt them to enter the code to confirm their identity. These endpoints can be used to verify a user’s identity or to confirm ownership of a specific email or phone number. This verification step is highly recommended when a user attempts to link a new email address or phone number to their account, ensuring the authenticity of the information provided.
