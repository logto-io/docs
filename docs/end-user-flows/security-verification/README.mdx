# Security verification

When authenticated users attempt sensitive or high-risk actions—such as changing their password, making a payment, or accessing sensitive information like paychecks or bank account details—additional security measures are essential. This flow is especially critical in sensitive applications like banking, healthcare, and government services.

This process, known as _security verification_, requires users to re-verify their identity to confirm they are the authorized account holder. By implementing security verification, the system reinforces protection against unauthorized access, adding a critical layer of security for high-risk actions and helping safeguard sensitive data.
