# Secure webhooks

Once your server is ready to receive webhook requests, you may want to make sure that it can handle the requests securely. Logto generates a signature for each webhook request payload, which allows you to verify that the request comes from Logto.

## Get the signing key

You'll need to get the signing key from webhook details page in <CloudLink to="/webhooks"> Logto Console > Webhooks</CloudLink> to verify the signature.

## Verify the signature

Extract the signature from the `logto-signature-sha-256` header of the webhook request.

After that, you should generate a signature using your signing key, and the webhook request body and ensure that the result matches the signature from Logto.

:::note
Use the raw body of the webhook request for signature generation; avoid using the parsed body, as servers may preprocess it before reaching your webhook endpoint handler.
:::

Logto uses an HMAC hex digest to compute the signature.

Here's an example of how to verify the signature in Node.js:

```tsx
import { createHmac } from 'node:crypto';

export const verify = (signingKey: string, rawBody: Buffer[], expectedSignature: string) => {
  const hmac = createHmac('sha256', signingKey);
  hmac.update(rawBody);
  const signature = hmac.digest('hex');
  return signature === expectedSignature;
};
```
