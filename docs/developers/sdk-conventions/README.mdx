# Platform SDK conventions

Logto provides a very powerful and flexible web authentication service.

In practical use of Logto's services, for convenience, it is often necessary for developers to integrate the Logto SDK into their own client applications to manage user sign-in status, permissions, and more.

You can find SDKs for all programming languages/frameworks supported by Logto [here](/quick-starts).

If you're unlucky and don't find the SDK you want, here is a convention you can follow to implement the SDK for your desired programming language, making it easier to use Logto services.

This convention contains three main parts:

<Url href="/developers/sdk-conventions/core-sdk-convention">Core SDK convention</Url>
<Url href="/developers/sdk-conventions/platform-sdk-convention">Platform SDK conventio</Url>
