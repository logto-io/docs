# Create a custom token claims script

To [add custom claims](/developers/custom-token-claims) to the [access token](https://auth.wiki/access-token), you need to provide a script that returns an object containing those claims. The script should be written as a `JavaScript` function that returns an object with the custom claims.

1. Navigate to <CloudLink to="/customize-jwt">Console > Custom JWT</CloudLink>.
2. There are two different types of access tokens that you can customize the access token claims for:

   - **User access token**: The access token issued for end users. E.g., for Web applications or mobile applications.
   - **Machine-to-Machine access token**: The access token issued for the services or applications. E.g. for [machine-to-machine applications](/quick-starts/m2m).

   Different types of access tokens may have different token payload contexts. You may customize the token claims for each type of access token separately.

   Pick any type of access token you want to customize the token claims for, and click on the **Add custom claims** button to create a new script.

:::note
The custom token claims feature is only available to:

- [Logto OSS](/logto-oss) users
- [Logto Cloud tenants with developement environment](/logto-cloud/tenant-settings#development)
- Logto Cloud paid tenants with production environment (including [Pro tenants and Enterprise tenants](https://logto.io/pricing))

## Implement `getCustomJwtClaims()` function

In the **Custom JWT** details page, you may find the script editor to write your custom token claims script. The script should be a `JavaScript` function that returns an object of custom claims.

![Custom token claims detail page](../assets/custom-jwt-detail-page.png)

## Step 1: Edit the script

Use the code editor on the left side to modify the script. A default `getCustomJwtClaims` with an empty object return value is provided for you to start with. You may modify the function to return an object of your own custom claims.

```jsx
const getCustomJwtClaims = async ({ token, context, environmentVariables }) => {
  return {};
};
```

This editor uses the JavaScript language server to provide basic syntax highlighting, code completion, and error checking. The input parameter are well typed and documented in jsDoc style. You may use the IntelliSense of the editor to access the properties of the input object correctly. You may find the detailed parameter definitions on the right side of the page.

:::note
This function will be exported as a module. Make sure remain the function name as `getCustomJwtClaims` so the module can export the function correctly.
:::

## Step 2: Input parameters

The `getCustomJwtClaims` function takes an object as the input parameter. The input object contains the following properties:

### token

The token payload object. This object contains original token claims and metadata that you may need to access in the script.

You may find the detailed type definition of the token payload object and user data object on the right side of the page. The IntelliSense of the editor will also help you access these properties of the input object correctly.

- User access token data object
  | Property | Description | Type |
  | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
  | `jti` | The unique JWT id | `string` |
  | `aud` | The audience of the token | `string` |
  | `scope` | The scopes of the token | `string` |
  | `clientId` | The client id of the token | `string` |
  | `accountId` | The user id of the token | `string` |
  | `expiresWithSession` | Whether the token will expire with the session | `boolean` |
  | `grantId` | The current authentication grant id of the token | `string` |
  | `gty` | The grant type of the token | `string` |
  | `kind` | The token kind | `AccessToken` |
- Machine-to-machine access token data object
  | Property | Description | Type |
  | ---------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
  | `jti` | The unique JWT id | `string` |
  | `aud` | The audience of the token | `string` |
  | `scope` | The scopes of the token | `string` |
  | `clientId` | The client id of the token | `string` |
  | `kind` | The token kind | `ClientCredentials` |

### context (Only available for user access token)

The context object contains the user data and grant data that relevant to the current authorization process.

- **User data object**
  For user access token, Logto provides additional user data context for you to access. The user data object contains all the user profile data and organization membership data you may need to set up the custom claims. Please check [Users](/user-management/user-data) and [Organizations](/organizations/organization-data) for more details.
- **Grant data object**
  For user access token granted by impersonation token exchange, Logto provides additional grant data context for you to access. The grant data object contains the custom context from the subject token. Please check [Impersonation](/developers/user-impersonation) for more details.

### environmentVariables

Use the **Set environment variables** section on the right to set up the environment variables for your script. You may use these variables to store sensitive information or configuration data that you don't want to hardcode in the script. e.g. API keys, secrets, or URLs.

All the environment variables you set here will be available in the script. Use the `environmentVariables` object in the input parameter to access these variables.

### api

The `api` object provides a set of utility functions that you may use in your script for additional access control over the token issuing process. The `api` object contains the following functions:

```jsx
api.denyAccess(message?: string): void
```

The `api.denyAccess()` function allows you to deny the token issuing process with a custom message. You may use this function to enforce additional access validation over the token issuing process.

## Step 3: Fetch external data

You may use the node built-in `fetch` function to fetch external data in your script. The `fetch` function is a promise-based function that allows you to make HTTP requests to external APIs.

```jsx
const getCustomJwtClaims = async ({ environmentVariables }) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${environmentVariables.API_KEY}`,
    },
  });

  const data = await response.json();

  return {
    data,
  };
};
```

:::note
Be aware, any external data fetching may introduce latency to the token issuing process. Make sure the external API is reliable and fast enough to meet your requirements.

What's more:

- Handle the error and timeout properly in your script to avoid the token issuing process being blocked.
- Use proper authorization headers to protect your external API from unauthorized access.
  :::

## Step 4: Test the script

Make sure to test your script before saving it. Click on the **Test context** tab on the right side of the page to modify the mock token payload and user data context for testing.

Click on the **Run test** on the right-top corner of the editor to run the script with the mock data. The output of the script will be displayed in the **Test Result** drawer.

![Test custom JWT script](../assets/test-custom-jwt-script.png)

:::note
The test result is the output of the `getCustomJwtClaims` function with the mock data you set ("extra token claims" got after completing the step 3 in [the sequence diagram](/developers/custom-token-claims/#how-do-custom-token-claims-work)). The real token payload and user data context will be different when the script is executed in the token issuing process.
:::

Click on the **Create** button to save the script. The custom token claims script will be saved and applied to the access token issuing process.
