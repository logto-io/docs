### Optional: Handle user permission change \{#optional-handle-user-permission-change}

User permissions can change at any time. Because Logto issues JWTs for RBAC, permission updates only appear in newly issued tokens, and never modify existing JWTs.

:::info Scope subset rule
An access token can only include scopes that were requested in the original OAuth authorization flow.
Even if a user gains new permissions, the token issued later can only contain a subset of the originally requested scopes.
To access newly granted scopes that were not part of the initial request, the client must run a new authorization flow.

#### Downscoped permissions \{#downscoped-permissions}

When a user loses permissions:

- Newly issued tokens immediately reflect the reduced scopes.
- Existing JWTs keep the old scopes until they expire.
- Your API should always validate scopes and rely on short token lifetimes.

If you need faster reactions, implement your own signal that tells clients to refresh their tokens.

#### Enlarged permissions \{#enlarged-permissions}

{props.type === "global" && <p>For global API resources, when a user gains permissions, enlarged permissions will NOT show up through refresh. The client must perform a new OAuth authorization flow to obtain a token that includes the new scopes. This can happen silently if the user has an active Logto session.</p>}

{props.type === "organization" && <p>For organization tokens, when a user gains permissions, enlarged permissions will show up on the next issuance (refresh or token request). A new token is still required, but no full re-auth is needed unless the new scopes exceed the original request set.</p>}

#### Recommendations \{#recommendations}

- Validate scopes in your API on every call.
- Keep token expiration short.
- Add optional notifications if you need immediate permission-change propagation.
