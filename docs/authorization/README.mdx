# Authorization

[Authorization](https://auth.wiki/authorization) defines what actions a user can perform or which resources they can access after being authenticated, determining what they can do in your app.

Logto authorization service uses a **token-based** mechanism. While Logto provides `access token`, your resource server is responsible for validating and enforcing them as part of access control.

There are two types of [access tokens](https://auth.wiki/access-token):

1. **Access tokens**: Used to access user/system API resources.
2. **Organization tokens**: Special access tokens for organization resources, used in a multi-tenant architecture when the organization feature is enabled.

Logto offers authorization services for various scenarios. Here are several typical use cases and you can choose the right one and match your requirements with Logto’s features and services.

You can also use tools like [custom token claims](/developers/custom-token-claims) to include additional claims in access tokens to meet your custom technical requirements. Also more advanced use case: [Protect your API resources using organization-level RBAC (organization template)](/authorization/organization-template/protect-api-reources)

## Get familiar with Role-based access control

Role-based access control is used throughout the entire Logto infrastructure, at both the system (Role-based access control) organization levels (organization RBAC):

1. **Subjects**: These can be real users (or members in organization context) or non-human entities, like machine-to-machine apps.
2. **API resources**: The resources within your system that need protection.
3. **Roles**: Represent job functions or responsibilities.
4. **Permissions**: Define what actions are authorized on specific resources.

<Rbac style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />

Managing these entities and their relationships allows you to flexibly meet your access control needs. In Logto, you may use RBAC in two levels, user/systems level (no intermediate organization layer involved.), and organizations. In the organization context, it has an independent RBAC design we called it “Organization template”.
