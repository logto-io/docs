# Integrate Logto

Logto provides comprehensive authentication solutions for web, mobile and desktop applications, supports Machine-to-Machine (M2M) authentication between services, and can serve as an Identity Provider (IdP) for third-party applications through standard protocols like OIDC and OAuth 2.0.

Start your integration by selecting the solution that best matches your needs:

## Add authentication for your application

Whether you're building user-facing applications (like web, mobile, or desktop apps) or machine-to-machine (M2M) applications for service-to-service communication, you can quickly implement comprehensive authentication and user management features by integrating Logto.

Find integration guides for your preferred framework or programming language:

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Quick start',
      href: '/integrate-logto/quick-start',
      description: 'Useful guides for integrating Logto into your application.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <GuidesIcon />,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

Or try a no-code integration solution via Protected App when youâ€™re using Logto Cloud:

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Protected App',
      href: '/integrate-logto/protected-app',
      description: 'No-code integration solution powered by Cloudflare Workers.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <ProtectedAppIcon />,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## Build advanced features based on Logto service

When you need to extend Logto's abilities to enhance your product (such as managing multi-tenant organizations, or automating workflows with Logto), you can leverage Logto Management API to build advanced features to fit your product needs.

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Interact with Management API',
      href: '/integrate-logto/interact-with-management-api',
      description:
        'Direct interaction with Logto for granular control via Machine-to-Machine application.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <CloudConnectionIcon />,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## Use Logto as an Identity Provider

When you want to enable third-party applications to authenticate with your Logto identity system, you can configure Logto as an Identity Provider (IdP).

Logto can be used as an IdP through standard protocols like OAuth, OIDC, or SAML (coming soon), and external services can implement "Sign in with Logto" just like "Sign in with Google", allowing their users to authenticate using your Logto user system.

By creating third-party applications in Logto, you establish secure connections between your identity system and external services.

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Third-party application',
      href: '/integrate-logto/third-party-application',
      description: 'Use Logto as an identity provider (IdP) for 3rd-party applications.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <IntegrateIcon width={20} height={20} />,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>
