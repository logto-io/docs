# Integrate Logto authentication

Logto provides comprehensive authentication solutions for web, mobile and desktop applications, supports [Machine-to-Machine (M2M)](/quick-starts/m2m) authentication between services, and can serve as an Identity Provider (IdP) for [third-party applications](/integrate-logto/third-party-applications) through standard protocols like [OpenID Connect(OIDC)](https://auth.wiki/openid-connect) and [OAuth 2.0](https://auth.wiki/oauth-2.0).

Start your integration by selecting the solution that best matches your needs:

## Add authentication for your applications \{#add-authentication-for-your-applications}

Whether you're building user-facing applications (like web, mobile, or desktop apps) or machine-to-machine (M2M) applications for service-to-service communication, you can quickly implement comprehensive [authentication](/end-user-flows) and [user management](/user-management) features by integrating Logto.

Find integration guides for your preferred framework or programming language:

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Integrate Logto into your application',
      href: '/integrate-logto/integrate-logto-into-your-application',
      description: 'Useful guides for integrating Logto into your application.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <GuidesIcon />,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

Or try a no-code integration solution via Protected App when youâ€™re using Logto Cloud:

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Protected App',
      href: '/integrate-logto/protected-app',
      description: 'No-code integration solution powered by Cloudflare Workers.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <ProtectedAppIcon />,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## Add SAML apps \{#add-saml-apps}

Logto (as an Identity Provider) supports integration with SAML protocol-based applications (as a Service Provider). Through SAML app integration, you can provide enterprise users with a secure, standardized Single Sign-On (SSO) experience.

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'SAML app',
      href: '/integrate-logto/saml-app',
      description:
        'As a SAML identity provider (IdP) to provide a SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) experience.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <IntegrateIcon width={20} height={20} />,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## Add OIDC/OAuth apps \{#add-oidc-oauth-apps}

When you want to enable third-party applications to authenticate with your Logto identity system, you can configure Logto as an [Identity Provider (IdP)](https://auth.wiki/identity-provider).

Logto can be used as an IdP through standard protocols like OAuth, OIDC, and external services can implement "Sign in with Logto" just like "Sign in with Google", allowing their users to authenticate using your Logto user system.

By creating third-party applications in Logto, you establish secure connections between your identity system and external services.

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Third-party apps (OIDC/OAuth)',
      href: '/integrate-logto/third-party-applications',
      description:
        'As an OIDC/OAuth IdP to offer user consent: Securely share your user profiles and resources with partner apps.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <IntegrateIcon width={20} height={20} />,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## Extend Logto features with Management API \{#extend-logto-features-with-management-api}

Logto [Management API](https://openapi.logto.io/) enables you to programmatically control and automate Logto functionality in your applications.

When you need to extend Logto's abilities to enhance your product (such as [managing multi-tenant organizations](/organizations), or automating workflows with Logto), you can leverage Logto Management API to build advanced features to fit your product needs.

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Interact with Management API',
      href: '/integrate-logto/interact-with-management-api',
      description:
        'Programmatically control and automate Logto functionality using Management API.',
      customProps: {
        icon: <CloudConnectionIcon />,
      },
    },
