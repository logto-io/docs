# Integrate Logto into your application

Follow these steps to add authentication to your applications with Logto, whether it's a user-facing app or machine-to-machine service:

1. Navigate to <CloudLink to="/applications">Console > Applications</CloudLink>

2. Click "Create application" to add a new application

3. Choose your [application framework](/quick-starts) to begin. If you can't find your framework, click the "Create app without framework" button in the bottom right of the application creation page to create an app by selecting an [Application type](/integrate-logto/application-data-structure/#application-types) or file a feature request or contribute a SDK by following our [SDK conventions](/developers/sdk-conventions).

4. After selecting your framework, you'll see a quick start guide for the framework's SDK. Follow the steps to configure and integrate your application. If you need help understanding the concepts involved in the integration process, you can refer to [Understanding Logto authentication flow](/integrate-logto/integrate-logto-into-your-application/understand-authentication-flow/) for a deeper understanding of the integration.

:::note
The guide in the console is only for quick start with Logto using our SDK. For complete integration guides, including advanced SDK usage, check out [Quick starts](/quick-starts) section.
