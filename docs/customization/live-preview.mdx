# Live preview

You can use the **Live preview** feature for convenient testing of your sign-in experience configurations.

Navigating to <CloudLink to="/sign-in-experience">Console > Sign-in experience</CloudLink>" and clicking the "Live preview" button in the top right corner will open a new browser tab with a fully functional demo of Logto's capabilities. This demo showcases our experience design approach for sign-in and sign-up flows. It is highly customizable and can be seamlessly integrated into your application.

:::note

**Note**: In this preview, you should create an account first to test the experience. You can manage this account later in <CloudLink to="/user-management">Console > User management</CloudLink>.

:::

If you try to sign in with the user account you created and the process is successful with no issues, you will be redirected to a success page that displays your identifiers and ID.
