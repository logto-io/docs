# Match your brand

## Omni sign-in experience

Customize the look and feel of your sign-in page by navigating to <CloudLink to="/sign-in-experience/branding">Console > Sign-in experience > Branding</CloudLink>. This section allows you to easily adjust key branding elements.

**Brand color**

Define the primary color used throughout the sign-in experience, including primary buttons, links, and other components. Replace the default Logto purple color with your brand's color. For dark mode, a separate brand color can be specified.

**Company logo**

The logo will be displayed on the sign-in homepage, sign-up home, loading page, and other interfaces with our expansion.

- There are some limitations for images: they must be under 500KB and in SVG, PNG, JPG, JPEG, or ICO format.
- If you leave the logo field blank, the logo will not display in the interface.
- A dark mode version of the logo can also be uploaded.

**Favicon**

A favicon is a small icon representing a website and is displayed in the browser tab, bookmarks, and other areas of the browser interface.

- The image must be under 500KB and in SVG, PNG, JPG, JPEG, or ICO format. Uploading a square image is recommended to ensure a good presentation effect.
- A dark mode version of the favicon can also be uploaded.
- Besides, the browser title for different flows (Sign in/Sign up/Forgot password, etc.) is now used instead of a custom title.

**Dark mode**

Enable dark mode to automatically adjust the sign-in page's appearance based on the user's system preferences.

## App-specific branding

If your multi-app business needs app-level sign-in experiences, you can configure this in the application details page. Navigate to <CloudLink to="/applications">Console > Applications</CloudLink>.

By switching on "app-level sign-in experience", you can set up specific branding and colors for each app. When a sign-in initiated from an app with app-level branding enabled, the sign-in experience will be customized according to the app-level branding settings; otherwise, it will default to the omni sign-in experience settings.

Both light and dark mode settings are available for app-level branding. Dark mode settings will only take effect when the dark mode is enabled in the [omni sign-in experience](#omni-sign-in-experience) settings.

## Organization-specific branding

To dynamically show your client’s organization logo in the sign-in experience, you can upload the organization logos in the organization settings page. Navigate to <CloudLink to="/organizations">Console > Organizations</CloudLink>.

Then, when triggering a sign-in, you can pass the organization ID in the `organization_id` parameter to tell Logto which organization logo to display. For example, to show the organization logo for organization ID `123456`:

- If you are using Logto SDK, you can pass the `organization_id` parameter in the `extraParams` object of the `signIn` method.
- If you are using an OIDC client, you can pass the `organization_id` parameter when requesting the [authorization endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthorizationEndpoint).

Both light and dark mode settings are available for organization-level branding. Dark mode settings will only take effect when the dark mode is enabled in the [omni sign-in experience](#omni-sign-in-experience) settings.

Here's an example of how to pass the `organization_id` parameter in the `signIn` method using [Logto browser SDK](/quick-starts/vanilla-js/#implement-sign-in-and-sign-out):

**index.ts**

```tsx
logtoClient.signIn({
  // ...other parameters
  redirectUri: 'https://your-redirect-uri',
  extraParams: {
    organization_id: '123456',
  },
});
```

:::note

We are gradually rolling out the `extraParams` feature to all Logto SDKs. If you don't see it in your SDK yet, please contact us.
