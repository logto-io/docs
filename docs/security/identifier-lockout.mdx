# Identifier lockout

## Sentinel \{#sentinel}

The identifier lockout policy allows you to customize your own sentinel policy settings to protect against account sign-in/sign-up abuse. This policy works by monitoring authentication attempts for each identifier (such as usernames or email addresses) and implementing restrictions when suspicious activity is detected. If a user exceeds the allowed number of failed authentication attempts, the system temporarily locks the identifier, preventing further authentication attempts for a specified duration. This helps to mitigate brute-force attacks and enhances overall account security.

Visit the <CloudLink to="/security/general"> Console > Security > General</CloudLink> to configure the identifier lockout settings.

## Applicaiton of the policy \{#applicaiton-of-the-policy}

The identifier lockout (sentinel) policy will be applied in the following user interaction flows:

- **Identifier sign-in**: Password and verification code
- **Identifier sign-up**: Email/phone verification code
- **Reset password**: Email/phone verification code

## Policy settings \{#policy-settings}

1. **Maximum failed attempts**:

   - Limit the number of consecutive failed authentication attempts per identifier within an hour. If the limit is exceeded, the identifier will be temporarily locked out.
   - **Default Value**: 100

2. **Lockout duration (minutes)**:

   - Block all authentication attempts for the given identifier for a specified period after exceeding the maximum failed attempts.
   - **Default Value**: 60 minutes

3. **Manual unblock**:
   - Administrators can manually unblock users by providing a list of identifiers that need to be released from the lockout. The given identifiers must be precisely matched with the identifiers being blocked.
