# Organizations

The organizations feature is particularly effective in multi-tenant SaaS and [business-to-business (B2B) apps](/introduction/plan-your-architecture/b2b). In addition to individual users, your clients can also consist of teams, organizations, or entire companies.

With this fundamental element, you can build the must-have features for [multi-tenancy apps](https://auth.wiki/multi-tenancy), such as:

- A product that can be used by multiple organizations.
- Organization member provision on an [invitation](/end-user-flows/organization-experience/invite-organization-members) or [just-in-time](/organizations/just-in-time-provisioning) basis.
- [Access controls](/authorization/organization-template) that defined by roles assigned to members within an organization.
- Link organizations with [Enterprise SSO (single sign-on)](/end-user-flows/enterprise-sso) experience.

The term "organization" is also used in other forms, such as "workspace", "team", "company", etc. In Logto, we use "organization" as the generic term to represent the concept of multi-tenancy.

## Planning considerations

When using up organizations, integration may involve different levels of effort, we suggest you cross-reference those to customize your development.

- **Organization experience**: What would the organization experience be? Can an organization admin create its organization? Can organization admins invite members? Do you intend to build a custom dashboard that allows administrators to self-manage their organization members’ identity-related info?
- **Roles and access control**: Does the application need users to have specific roles assigned within their organizations?
- **Manage organizations through Logto Console and Management API:** What configuration would you like to set up directly in the Logto Console and Management API?
