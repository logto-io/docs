# Understand how organizations work

To get a holistic view of understanding, it's important to understand the entities involved in organization features and these are the fundamentals to integrate organizations into your app.

## Organization

Organization consists of a group of [users (identities)](/user-management/user-data). It can represent the teams, business customers, and partner companies who can access to your application.

The introduction of an organization as an entity is important, as it not only groups users but also provides a context for tenant isolation in multi-tenant apps.

## Organization member

In Logto, a user who has the membership of an organization is referred to as an organization member (i.e. member) within that organization's context.

## Organization M2M application

Organization M2M application refers to the [machine-to-machine applications](/quick-starts/m2m) that are associated with an organization. Similar to [organization members](#organization-member), organization applications are scoped within the context of an organization.

Once you associate an application with an organization, the application can be assigned [organization roles](/authorization/organization-template/configure-organization-template#create-organization-role). This is useful when you want to allow non-interaction access to organization resources.

:::note

Other types of applications do not support organization association and organization roles, as they are designed for user interaction.

Refer this [section](/organizations/organization-management) to manage organizations, members, and applications.

## Organization template

Organization template is designed for access control needs in multi-tenant apps. It includes organization roles and organization permissions. Check out this [organization template](/authorization/organization-template) to learn more about the access control design in organization.
