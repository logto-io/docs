# Upgrading your OSS version

Logto follows [semver](https://semver.org/), so If we don't mention it in the changelog, you can feel free to upgrade Logto without changing your code or database schema. You can find the release list in [Github Release](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/releases).

## Step 1: Update to the new version \{#step-1-update-to-the-new-version}

To update, follow the appropriate method based on your deployment:

- **Docker Image**: Pull the latest image.
- **NPM Package**: Upgrade to the latest version.
- **Tar File**: Download the latest `.tar` file from the release page.

## Step 2: Apply database alterations \{#step-2-apply-database-alterations}

Use the [Logto CLI](/logto-oss/using-cli/database-alteration/) to perform the necessary database alterations. For a seamless upgrade, there’s no need to stop the production app. Logto ensures that the new database schema remains compatible with the existing code, so production will continue running smoothly without interruptions.

## Step 3: Restart the application \{#step-3-restart-the-application}

After updating the code and applying the database alterations, restart your application to apply the changes. Ensure that the new version is running smoothly and that all components are functioning as expected.

**Tip**: To achieve a zero-downtime upgrade, consider using a “swap” strategy, where you gradually shift traffic from the old instance to the new one. This way, users experience no disruption during the upgrade.

Your upgrade is now complete!
