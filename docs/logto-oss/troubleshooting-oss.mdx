# Troubleshooting for OSS

<details>

  My browser cannot load Admin Console (showing error <code>Crypto.subtle is unavailable...</code>)
</summary>

Admin Console uses [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API), which requires [secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts), i.e. HTTPS or HTTP with `localhost`.

If you use HTTP with an IP address or custom domain, then the browser cannot load Admin Console.

  I'm using a custom domain, but my browser cannot load Admin Console (showing error{' '}
  <code>"code": "oidc.invalid_redirect_uri"</code>)
</summary>

If you are using a custom domain rather than `localhost`, you need to set the environment variable `ENDPOINT` to the Logto URL. It is because of the strict requirement of Redirect URI in OIDC. See [Configuration](/concepts/core-service/configuration/) for details.

<summary>
  I'm using an HTTPS proxy (e.g., Nginx) in front of Logto, but I failed on sign-in (showing error{' '}
  <code>TypeError: Failed to fetch</code>)
</summary>

- First, make sure you have set the node environment variable `TRUST_PROXY_HEADER` to `true`. See [Configuration](/concepts/core-service/configuration/#using-a-https-proxy) for details.
- Also, you need to set `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to `https` in your proxy config. See [Trusting TLS offloading proxies](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/blob/main/docs/README.md#trusting-tls-offloading-proxies) for details.

<summary>I'm facing CORS issues.</summary>

- If `ADMIN_ENDPOINT` is not specified, `localhost:[admin-port]` will be allowed to perform Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Logto.
- If `ADMIN_ENDPOINT` is specified, only requests from the origin of `ADMIN_ENDPOINT` will be allowed.

<summary>
  What is this again? <code>Error: Invalid id token</code>
</summary>

If you are not messing up with your tokens, then in most cases this is caused by a mismatch of your server time and client time. Sync the time on both your server and client and try again.
