# I18n translation with CLI

Logto translate CLI is a powerful tool designed for developers contributing to Logto's i18n efforts. With this CLI, you can focus on writing content in English, and then easily translate it into all supported languages.

For regular Logto users seeking custom translations without contributing to the project, please refer to our [localization guide](/customization/localized-languages/).

:::info
Started from v1.20.0, the translation command is removed from the `@logto/cli`, and maintained as a standalone `@logto/translation` package in the logto monorepo. Accordingly, the way of execution is slightly different.
:::

## Migrate from `@logto/cli`

Here's a comparison of the old and new CLI execution methods:

Old method (before v1.20.0):

```bash
pnpm cli translate <command> [options]
```

New method:

```bash
pnpm translate <command> [options]
```

## Sync keys

Let's say we made some changes to the translation keys in the `en` folder of the `phrases` package. We want to sync these changes to the `pt-BR` folder. Run the command below to sync translation keys and file structure:

```bash
pnpm translate sync-keys --target pt-BR
```

This command will read all translation keys from the source language folder (`en` by default) and sync them to the target language folder (`pt-BR` in this example).

- If the target language folder doesn't exist, it will be created automatically;
- If the target language folder already exists, it will be updated with new keys and removed with obsolete keys.

For each translation key:

- If a key is missing in the target, it will be added with a comment to indicate that the phrase is untranslated (marked with `/** UNTRANSLATED */`);
- If a key is missing in the baseline, it will be removed from the target;
- If a key exists in both the baseline and the target, the value of the target will be used.

To sync keys for all languages in the `phrases` package, run the command below:

```bash
pnpm translate sync-keys --target all
```

Thus we can focusing on updating the translation keys in the source language folder, and the translation keys in other languages will be updated automatically.

:::info
This command executes for `phrases` package by default. You can specify the package name by `--package` option. For example, use `--package phrases-experience` to sync keys for the `phrases-experience` package.
:::

After syncing keys, we can translate the keys using ChatGPT API.

## Translate keys using ChatGPT

Run the command below to translate keys using ChatGPT:

```bash
pnpm translate sync
```

This command will translate all untranslated keys (marked with `/** UNTRANSLATED */`) across all languages in the `phrases` and `phrases-experience` packages. Note an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required to run this command.
