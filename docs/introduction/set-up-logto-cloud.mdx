# Set up Logto Cloud

This section covers basic setup steps and key actions to effectively deliver your product and manage your development workflow.

## Create Logto tenant

First, sign up for a business and create a Logto tenant. A tenant of Logto Cloud is an isolated environment where you can manage user identities, applications, and all other Logto resources.

Your first tenant will be automatically set up as a [**Development**](/logto-cloud/tenant-settings#development) environment. This is ideal for testing and development purposes and is free to use.

Check out the tenant settings and [learn more](/logto-cloud) about Logto cloud service.

## Invite collaborators

During the onboarding, you have a chance to invite collaborators to do the development work together. If would like to do more or later. Go to <CloudLink to="/tenant-settings/members">Tenant settings > Members</CloudLink>. You'll see your current members and can invite more. Enter email addresses and assign roles (you can do this in bulk) and then send.

## Move to production tenant

You may spend some time developing and testing Logto’s capabilities and features to put together a proof of concept.

After your project completes testing and is ready for the next phase, remember to create a new [production-type tenant](/logto-cloud/tenant-settings#production) (requiring a [Free or Pro tenant](https://logto.io/pricing)). Because the dev tenant is not intended for production use due to its [limitations and constraints](/logto-cloud/tenant-settings#development).

:::note

Make sure to enter the [custom domain](/logto-cloud/custom-domain) as soon as you create a production tenant, as it will impact your next-step configuration.

:::

This setup allows your project to have both development testing and production environments, helping you manage your development workflow smoothly.

## Migrate from the existing system

If you’re working on an existing project and need to switch auth providers, Logto supports user migration from other platforms. You can migrate [basic data](/user-management/user-data#basic-data), [custom data](/user-management/user-data#custom-data), [social identities](/user-management/user-data#social-identities), and password hashes. For details, see the [Migrate to Logto](../user-management/user-migration.mdx) guide.
