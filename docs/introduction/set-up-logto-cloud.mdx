# Set up Logto Cloud

This section covers basic setup steps and key actions to effectively deliver your product and manage your development workflow.

## Create Logto tenant

First, sign up for a business and create a Logto tenant. A tenant of Logto Cloud is an isolated environment where you can manage user identities, applications, and all other Logto resources.

Your first tenant will be automatically set up as a **Development** environment. This is ideal for testing and development purposes and is free to use.

Check out the tenant settings and [learn more](https://www.notion.so/13426f6af1dc8017a70ef475cca2305d?pvs=21) about Logto cloud service.

## Invite collaborators

During the onboarding, you have a chance to invite collaborators to do the development work together. If would like to do more or later. Go to <CloudLink to="/tenant-settings/members">Tenant Settings > Members</CloudLink>. You'll see your current members and can invite more. Enter email addresses and assign roles (you can do this in bulk) and then send.

## Move to production tenant

You may spend some time developing and testing Logto’s capabilities and features to put together a proof of concept.

After your project completes testing and is ready for the next phase, remember to create a new production-type tenant (requiring a Free or Pro tenant). Because the dev tenant is not intended for production use due to its limitations and constraints.

:::note

Make sure to enter the custom domain as soon as you create a production tenant, as it will impact your next-step configuration.

:::

This setup allows your project to have both development testing and production environments, helping you manage your development workflow smoothly.

## Migrate from the existing system

If you’re working on an existing project and need to switch auth providers, Logto supports user migration from other platforms. You can migrate basic data, custom data, social identities, and password hashes. For details, see the "[Migrate to Logto](https://www.notion.so/21ccab3f9514408b9e45dc151e85a552?pvs=21)" guide.
