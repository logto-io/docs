# B2B architecture

## Architecture

B2B apps typically use a multi-tenant architecture. In these applications, users own their accounts and manage their identity and authentication, with involvement from other parties like businesses or organizations. End-user identities are often not individual consumers but employees or collaborators within a business organization.
