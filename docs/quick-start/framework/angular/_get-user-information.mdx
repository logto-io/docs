Once the user has successfully signed in, Logto will issue an [ID token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken) that contains the user information claims. The ID token is a JSON Web Token (JWT).

It's important to note that the user information claims that can be retrieved depending on the
scopes used by the user during signing-in, and considering performance and data size, the ID token
may not contain all user claims, some user claims are only available in the [userinfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo) (see
the related list below).

The `buildAngularAuthConfig()` utility will enable `autoUserInfo` and `renewUserInfoAfterTokenRenew` if there's no `resource` provided in the config. This means that Logto will automatically fetch the user information after the user signs in and renew the user information after the token is renewed.

:::

Logto uses OIDC [scopes and claims conventions](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims) to define the scopes and claims for retrieving user information from the ID token and OIDC userinfo endpoint. Both of the "scope" and the "claim" are terms from the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) specifications.

In short, when you request a scope, you will get the corresponding claims in the user information. For example, if you request the `email` scope, you will get the `email` and `email_verified` data of the user.

By default, Logto SDK will always request three scopes: `openid`, `profile`. And `offline_access`.
