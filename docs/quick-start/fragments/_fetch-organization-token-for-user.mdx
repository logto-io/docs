If organization is new to you, please read [üè¢ Organizations (Multi-tenancy)](https://docs.logto.io/docs/recipes/organizations/) to get started.

You need to add <code>{props.organizationScope}</code> scope when configuring the Logto client:

{props.configOrganizationCode}

Once the user is signed in, you can fetch the organization token for the user:

{props.getOrganizationAccessTokenCode}
