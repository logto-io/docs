# Enable AI agent and third-party app access to your MCP server

:::note
The main difference between this guide and the previous one is that this guide will treat the MCP Inspector as a third-party app in Logto. If you want to integrate your MCP server with your own app, please refer to the [Enable auth for your MCP-powered apps with Logto](./mcp-server-add-auth) guide.
