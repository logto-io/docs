# Enable third-party AI agent access to your MCP server

This guide walks you through integrating Logto with your MCP server using [mcp-auth](https://mcp-auth.dev), allowing you to authenticate users and securely retrieve their identity information using the standard OpenID Connect flow.

You'll learn how to:

- Configure Logto as the authorization server for your MCP server.
- Set up a “whoami” tool in your MCP server to return the current user's identity claims.
- Test the flow with a third-party AI agent (MCP client).

After this tutorial, your MCP server will:

- Authenticate users in your Logto tenant.
- Return identity claims (`sub`, `username`, `name`, `email`, etc.) for the "whoami" tool invocation.

## Difference between third-party AI agent (MCP client) and your own MCP client \{#difference-between-third-party-ai-agent-mcp-client-and-your-own-mcp-client}

Let's take a look at an example. Imagine you’re a developer running an MCP server to manage email access and automation.

**Official email app (Your own MCP client)**

- You provide an official email app for users to read and manage their emails.
- How it works: The official email app connects to your MCP server using Logto to authenticate users. When Alice signs in, she automatically gets access to her emails, no extra permission screens needed, since it’s your trusted app.

**Third-party AI agent (Third-party MCP client)**

- You’re building an ecosystem around your MCP server, so another developer creates “SmartMail AI” (an AI assistant that can summarize emails and schedule meetings automatically) integrating it as a third-party client.
- How it works: SmartMail AI (third-party MCP client) wants to access user emails via your MCP server. When Alice signs in to SmartMail AI using her account:
  - She’s shown a consent screen, asking permission for SmartMail AI to read her emails and calendar.
  - Alice can allow or deny this access.
  - Only the data she consents to is shared with SmartMail AI, and SmartMail AI cannot access any additional data without explicit re-consent.

This access (permission) control ensures user data safety, even though your MCP server manages all the data, third-party apps like SmartMail AI can only access what the user has explicitly allowed. They cannot bypass this process, as it's enforced by your access control implementation in the MCP server.

**Summary**

| Client type          | Example                    | Consent required? | Who controls it?    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Official email app   | Your own email application | No                | You (the developer) |
| Third-party AI agent | SmartMail AI assistant     | Yes               | Another developer   |

## Test the integration \{#test-the-integration}

1. Start the MCP server.
2. Start the AI agent.
3. In the client, invoke the `whoami` tool to retrieve the current user's identity claims.
4. The client should handle the 401 Unauthorized response and redirect the user to Logto for authentication.
5. After successful authentication, the client should receive an access token and use it to make requests to the MCP server.
6. The client should be able to retrieve the identity claims from the MCP server using the access token.
