This guide walks you through integrating Logto with your service and enabling AI agents to access it.

You'll learn how to:

- Configure Logto as the authorization server for your service.
- Obtain an access token for the AI agent to access your service.
- Test the flow with an AI agent.

## Prerequisites

- A [Logto Cloud](https://cloud.logto.io) (or self-hosted) tenant
- A service that exposes API endpoints to be accessed by the AI agent

### Understanding the flow

- **Service**: The service you want to expose to the AI agent.
- **AI agent**: The AI agent that will access your service.
- **Logto**: Serves as the OpenID Connect provider (authorization server) and manages user identities.
