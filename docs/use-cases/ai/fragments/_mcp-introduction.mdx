This guide walks you through integrating Logto with your MCP server using [mcp-auth](https://mcp-auth.dev), allowing you to authenticate users and securely retrieve their identity information using the standard OpenID Connect flow.

You'll learn how to:

- Configure Logto as the authorization server for your MCP server.
- Set up a “whoami” tool to return the current user's identity claims.
- Test the flow with the MCP Inspector. {props.isThirdPartyApp && <span><b>The MCP Inspector will be treated as a third-party app in Logto.</b></span>}

After this tutorial, your MCP server will:

- Authenticate users in your Logto tenant.
- Return identity claims (`sub`, `username`, `name`, `email`, etc.) for the "whoami" tool invocation.

Once the integration is complete, you can replace the MCP Inspector with your own MCP client, such as a web app, to access the tools and resources exposed by your MCP server.
