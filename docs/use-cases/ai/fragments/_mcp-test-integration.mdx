## Test the integration

1. Start the MCP server
2. Start the MCP Inspector.

   Due to the limit of the current MCP Inspector implementation, we need to use the forked version from mcp-auth:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mcp-auth/inspector.git
   cd inspector
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   Then, open the URL shown in the terminal.

3. In the MCP Inspector:

   - **Transport Type**: `SSE`
   - **URL**: `http://localhost:3001/sse`
   - **OAuth Client ID**: Paste your Logto App ID
   - **Auth Params**: `{"scope": "openid profile email"}`
   - **Redirect URI**: This URL should be auto-populated. Copy it.

4. Find the application you created earlier in the Logto Console, open the details page, and paste the redirect URI into the **Settings** / **Redirect URIs** section. Save the changes.
5. Back in the MCP Inspector, click **Connect**. This should redirect you to the Logto sign-in experience.

{props.isThirdPartyApp && 22_222}

After completing sign-in, you should be redirected back to the MCP Inspector. Go to **Tools** -> **List Tools** -> **whoami** -> **Run Tool**.

You should see user claims, such as:

```json
{
  "sub": "user_XXXX",
  "username": "alice",
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```
