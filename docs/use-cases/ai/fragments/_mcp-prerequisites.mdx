## Prerequisites

- A [Logto Cloud](https://cloud.logto.io) (or self-hosted) tenant
- Node.js or Python environment

### Understanding the architecture

- **MCP server**: The server that exposes tools and resources to MCP clients.
- **MCP Inspector**: A MCP client used to initiate the authentication flow and test the integration.
- **Logto**: Serves as the OpenID Connect provider (authorization server) and manages user identities.

A non-normative sequence diagram illustrates the overall flow of the process:

    participant Client as MCP Inspector
    participant Server as MCP Server
    participant Logto

    Client->>Server: Request access to a tool
    Server->>Client: Not authenticated (401 Unauthorized)
    Client->>Server: Request OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata
    Server->>Client: Return metadata retrieved from Logto
    Client->>Logto: Redirect to Logto for authentication
    Logto->>Logto: User authenticates
    Logto->>Client: Redirect back to MCP server with authorization code
    Client->>Logto: Request access token using authorization code
    Logto->>Client: Return access token
    Client->>Server: Request tool with access token
    Server->>Logto: Request user info using access token
    Logto->>Server: Return user info
    Server->>Client: Return tool response
```

:::note
Due to MCP is quickly evolving, the above diagram may not be fully up to date. Please refer to the [mcp-auth](https://mcp-auth.dev) documentation for the latest information.
