import Mermaid from '@theme/Mermaid';

## Prerequisites \{#prerequisites}

- A [Logto Cloud](https://cloud.logto.io) (or self-hosted) tenant
- Node.js or Python environment

### Understanding the architecture \{#understanding-the-architecture}

- **MCP server**: The server that exposes tools and resources to MCP clients.
- **MCP client**: A client used to initiate the authentication flow and test the integration. {<b>{props.isThirdParty ? 'The third-party AI agent will be used as the client in this guide.' : "We'll use the MCP Inspector as the client in this guide."}</b>}
- **Logto**: Serves as the OpenID Connect provider (authorization server) and manages user identities.

A non-normative sequence diagram illustrates the overall flow of the process:

<Mermaid value={`sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as MCP Client<br/>${props.isThirdParty ? '(third-party AI agent)' : '(MCP Inspector)'}
    participant Server as MCP Server
    participant Logto

    Server->>Logto: Request OpenID Connect configuration
    Logto->>Server: Return configuration
    Note over Server: Cache the configuration
    Client->>Server: Request access to a tool
    Server->>Client: Not authenticated (401 Unauthorized)
    Client->>Server: Request OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata
    Note over Server: In this context, “OpenID Connect configuration” and<br/>“OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata”<br/>refer to the same thing.
    Server->>Client: Return OpenID Connect configuration retrieved from Logto
    Client->>Logto: Redirect to Logto for authentication
    Logto->>Logto: User authenticates
    ${props.isThirdParty ? 'Logto->>Logto: User authorizes (consents) scopes<br/>to the third-party app' : ''}
    Logto->>Client: Redirect back to MCP server with authorization code
    Client->>Logto: Request access token using authorization code
    Logto->>Client: Return access token
    Client->>Server: Request tool with access token
    Server->>Logto: Request user info using access token
    Logto->>Server: Return user info
    Server->>Client: Return tool response`}
