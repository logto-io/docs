# Enable auth for your MCP-powered apps with Logto

This guide walks you through integrating Logto with your MCP server using [mcp-auth](https://mcp-auth.dev), allowing you to authenticate users and securely retrieve their identity information using the standard OpenID Connect flow.

You'll learn how to:

- Configure Logto as the authorization server for your MCP server.
- Set up a “whoami” tool in your MCP server to return the current user's identity claims.
- Test the flow with the MCP Inspector (MCP client).

After this tutorial, your MCP server will:

- Authenticate users in your Logto tenant.
- Return identity claims (`sub`, `username`, `name`, `email`, etc.) for the "whoami" tool invocation.

Once the integration is complete, you can replace the MCP Inspector with your own MCP client, such as a web app, to access the tools and resources exposed by your MCP server.

<Prerequisites />

## Set up app in Logto

1. Sign in to your Logto Console.
2. Go <CloudLink to="/applications">**Applications**</CloudLink> → **Create application** → **Create app without framework**.
3. Choose type: Single-page app.
4. Fill in the app name and other required fields, then click **Create application**.
5. Save and copy the **App ID** and **Issuer endpoint**.

## Test the integration

1. Start the MCP server
2. Start the MCP Inspector.

   Due to the limit of the current MCP Inspector implementation, we need to use the forked version from mcp-auth:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mcp-auth/inspector.git
   cd inspector
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   Then, open the URL shown in the terminal.

3. In the MCP Inspector:

   - **Transport Type**: `SSE`
   - **URL**: `http://localhost:3001/sse`
   - **OAuth Client ID**: Paste your Logto App ID
   - **Auth Params**: `{"scope": "openid profile email"}`
   - **Redirect URI**: This URL should be auto-populated. Copy it.

4. Find the application you created earlier in the Logto Console, open the details page, and paste the redirect URI into the **Settings** / **Redirect URIs** section. Save the changes.
5. Back in the MCP Inspector, click **Connect**. This should redirect you to the Logto sign-in experience.

After completing sign-in, you should be redirected back to the MCP Inspector. Go to **Tools** -> **List Tools** -> **whoami** -> **Run Tool**.

You should see user claims, such as:

```json
{
  "sub": "user_XXXX",
  "username": "alice",
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```
