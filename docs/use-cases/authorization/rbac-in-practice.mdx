# RBAC in practice: Implementing secure authorization for your application

Are you struggling with implementing a secure and scalable authorization system for your application? Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the industry standard for managing user permissions, but implementing it correctly can be challenging. This tutorial will show you how to build a robust RBAC system using a real-world Content Management System (CMS) example.

By following this guide, you'll learn:

- ‚ú® How to design and implement fine-grained permissions that give you precise control
- üîí Best practices for organizing permissions into meaningful roles
- üë§ Techniques for handling resource ownership effectively
- üöÄ Ways to make your authorization system scalable and maintainable
- üí° Practical implementation using a real-world CMS example

The complete source code for this tutorial is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/logto-io/rbac-sample).

## Understanding RBAC fundamentals \{#understanding-rbac-fundamentals}

Role-Based Access Control is more than just assigning permissions to users. It's about creating a structured approach to authorization that balances security with maintainability.

You can learn more about [What is RBAC](https://auth-wiki.logto.io/rbac) in the Auth Wiki.

Here are the key principles we'll follow in our implementation:

### Fine-grained permission design \{#fine-grained-permission-design}

Fine-grained permissions give you precise control over what users can do in your system. Instead of broad access levels like "admin" or "user", we define specific actions users can perform on resources. For example:

- `read:articles` - View any article in the system
- `create:articles` - Create new articles
- `update:articles` - Modify existing articles
- `publish:articles` - Change the publication status of articles

### Resource ownership and access control \{#resource-ownership-and-access-control}

Resource ownership is a fundamental concept in our CMS's authorization design. While RBAC defines what actions different roles can perform, ownership adds a personal dimension to access control:

- Authors automatically have access to articles they created
- This natural ownership model means authors can always view and edit their own content
- The system checks both role permissions OR ownership when handling article operations
- For example, even without the `update:articles` permission, an author can still edit their own articles
- This design reduces the need for extra role permissions while maintaining security

This dual-layer approach (roles + ownership) creates a more intuitive and secure system. Publishers and admins can still manage all content through their role permissions, while authors maintain control over their own work.

## Designing a secure APIs \{#designing-a-secure-apis}

Let's start by designing our CMS's core functionality through its API endpoints:

```
GET    /api/articles         # List all articles
GET    /api/articles/:id     # Get a specific article
POST   /api/articles        # Create a new article
PATCH  /api/articles/:id    # Update an article
DELETE /api/articles/:id    # Delete an article
PATCH  /api/articles/:id/published  # Change publication status
```

### Implement access control for your API \{#implement-access-control-for-your-api}

For each endpoint, we need to consider two aspects of access control:

1. Resource ownership - Does the user own this resource?
2. Role-based permissions - Does the user's role allow this operation?

Here's how we'll handle access for each endpoint:

| Endpoint                          | Access control logic                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET /api/articles                 | - Anyone with `list:articles` permission, OR authors can see their own articles |
| GET /api/articles/:id             | - Anyone with `read:articles` permission, OR author of the article              |
| POST /api/articles                | - Anyone with `create:articles` permission                                      |
| PATCH /api/articles/:id           | - Anyone with `update:articles` permission, OR author of the article            |
| DELETE /api/articles/:id          | - Anyone with `delete:articles` permission, OR author of the article            |
| PATCH /api/articles/:id/published | - Only users with `publish:articles` permission                                 |

### Creating a permission system that scales \{#creating-a-permission-system-that-scales}

Based on our API access requirements, we can define these permissions:

| Permission       | Description                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| list:articles    | View the list of all articles in the system |
| read:articles    | Read any article's full content             |
| create:articles  | Create new articles                         |
| update:articles  | Modify any article                          |
| delete:articles  | Delete any article                          |
| publish:articles | Change publication status                   |

Note that these permissions are only needed when accessing resources you don't own. Article owners can automatically:

- View their own articles (no `read:articles` needed)
- Edit their own articles (no `update:articles` needed)
- Delete their own articles (no `delete:articles` needed)

## Building effective roles \{#building-effective-roles}

Now that we have our API and permissions defined, we can create roles that group these permissions logically:

| Permission/Role  | üëë Admin                                           | üìù Publisher                                         | ‚úçÔ∏è Author                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Description**  | Full system access for complete content management | Can view all articles and control publication status | Can create new articles in the system |
| list:articles    | ‚úÖ                                                 | ‚úÖ                                                   | ‚ùå                                    |
| read:articles    | ‚úÖ                                                 | ‚úÖ                                                   | ‚ùå                                    |
| create:articles  | ‚úÖ                                                 | ‚ùå                                                   | ‚úÖ                                    |
| update:articles  | ‚úÖ                                                 | ‚ùå                                                   | ‚ùå                                    |
| delete:articles  | ‚úÖ                                                 | ‚ùå                                                   | ‚ùå                                    |
| publish:articles | ‚úÖ                                                 | ‚úÖ                                                   | ‚ùå                                    |

**Note**: Authors automatically have read/update/delete permissions for their own articles, regardless of role permissions.

Each role is designed with specific responsibilities in mind:

- **Admin**: Has complete control over the CMS, including all article operations
- **Publisher**: Focuses on content review and publication management
- **Author**: Specializes in content creation

This role structure creates a clear separation of concerns:

- Authors focus on creating content
- Publishers manage content quality and visibility
- Admins maintain overall system control

## Config RBAC in Logto \{#config-rbac-in-logto}

Before you start, you need to create a account in [Logto Cloud](https://cloud.logto.io), or you can also use an self-hosted Logto instance by using the [Logto OSS version](/logto-oss).

But for this tutorial, we will use Logto Cloud for simplicity.

### Setting up your application \{#setting-up-your-application}

1. Go to "Applications" in Logto Console to create a new react application
   - Application name: Content Management System
   - Application type: Traditional Web Application
   - Redirect URIs: http://localhost:5173/callback

![CMS React application](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/cms_application_3ed42f2256.png)

### Configuring API resources and permissions \{#configuring-api-resources-and-permissions}

1. Go to "API Resources" in Logto Console to create a new API resource
   - API name: CMS API
   - API identifier: https://api.cms.com
   - Add permissions to the API resource
     - `list:articles`
     - `read:articles`
     - `create:articles`
     - `update:articles`
     - `publish:articles`
     - `delete:articles`

![CMS API resource details](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/cms_api_resource_b15ae2b91a.png)

### Creating roles \{#creating-roles}

Go to Roles in Logto Console to create the following roles for the CMS

- Admin
  - with all permissions
- Publisher
  - with `read:articles`, `list:articles`, `publish:articles`
- Author
  - with `create:articles`

![Admin role](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/admin_role_53edb35ecf.png)

![Publisher role](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/publisher_role_2ac205cc32.png)

![Author role](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/author_role_f89cd99543.png)

### Assigning roles to users \{#assigning-roles-to-users}

Go to the "User management" section in Logto Console to create users.

In the user details's "Roles" tab, you can assign roles to the user.

In our example, we create 3 users with the following roles:

- Alex: Admin
- Bob: Publisher
- Charlie: Author

![User management](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/user_management_c0bc17119f.png)

![User details - Alex](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/user_details_alex_702f96ef9a.png)

:::note
For demonstration purposes, we create these resources and configurations through the Logto Console. In real projects, you can create these resources and configurations programmatically using the [Management API](/integrate-logto/interact-with-management-api) provided by Logto.
:::

## Integrate your frontend with Logto RBAC \{#integrate-your-frontend-with-logto-rbac}

Now, we have setup RBAC in Logto, we can start to integrate it into our frontend.

First, follow the [Logto Quick Starts](/quick-starts) to integrate Logto into your application.

In our example, we use [React](/quick-starts/react) for demonstration.

After you have setup Logto in your application, we need to add the RBAC configurations for Logto to work.

```tsx
// frontend/src/App.tsx

const logtoConfig: LogtoConfig = {
  appId: LOGTO_APP_ID, // The app ID you created in Logto Console
  endpoint: LOGTO_ENDPOINT, // The endpoint you created in Logto Console
  resources: [API_RESOURCE], // The API resource identifier you created in Logto Console, e.g. https://api.cms.com
  // All scopes that you may want to request from the API resource in the frontend
  scopes: [
    'list:articles',
    'create:articles',
    'read:articles',
    'update:articles',
    'delete:articles',
    'publish:articles',
  ],
};
```

Remember to sign out and sign in again to make this change take effect if you are already signed in.

When the user sign-in with Logto and request an access token for the API resources specified above, Logto will add scopes (permissions) related to the user's role to the access token.

You can use `getAccessTokenClaims` from `useLogto` hook to get the scopes from the access token.

```tsx
// frontend/src/hooks/use-user-data.ts

import { useLogto } from '@logto/react';
import { API_RESOURCE } from '../config';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export const useUserData = () => {
  const { getAccessTokenClaims } = useLogto();
  const [userScopes, setUserScopes] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [userId, setUserId] = useState<string>();

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchScopes = async () => {
      const token = await getAccessTokenClaims(API_RESOURCE);
      setUserScopes(token?.scope?.split(' ') ?? []);
      setUserId(token?.sub);
    };

    fetchScopes();
  }, [getAccessTokenClaims]);

  return { userId, userScopes };
};
```

And you can use the `userScopes` to check if the user has the permission to access the resource.

```tsx
// frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx

const Dashboard = () => {
  const { userId, userScopes } = useUserData();
  // ...

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... */}
      {(userScopes.includes('delete:articles') || article.ownerId === userId) && (
        <button
          onClick={() => handleDelete(article.id)}
          className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-900"
        >
          Delete
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Integrate your backend with Logto RBAC \{#integrate-your-backend-with-logto-rbac}

Now, it's time to integrate Logto RBAC into your backend.

### Backend authorization middleware \{#backend-authorization-middleware}

First, we need to add a middleware in the backend to check user permissions, verify if the user is logged in, and determine whether they have the necessary permissions to access certain APIs.

```javascript
// backend/src/middleware/auth.js

const { createRemoteJWKSet, jwtVerify } = require('jose');

const getTokenFromHeader = (headers) => {
  const { authorization } = headers;
  const bearerTokenIdentifier = 'Bearer';

  if (!authorization) {
    throw new Error('Authorization header missing');
  }

  if (!authorization.startsWith(bearerTokenIdentifier)) {
    throw new Error('Authorization token type not supported');
  }

  return authorization.slice(bearerTokenIdentifier.length + 1);
};

const hasScopes = (tokenScopes, requiredScopes) => {
  if (!requiredScopes || requiredScopes.length === 0) {
    return true;
  }
  const scopeSet = new Set(tokenScopes);
  return requiredScopes.every((scope) => scopeSet.has(scope));
};

const verifyJwt = async (token) => {
  const JWKS = createRemoteJWKSet(new URL(process.env.LOGTO_JWKS_URL));

  const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, JWKS, {
    issuer: process.env.LOGTO_ISSUER,
    audience: process.env.LOGTO_API_RESOURCE,
  });

  return payload;
};

const requireAuth = (requiredScopes = []) => {
  return async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
      // Extract the token
      const token = getTokenFromHeader(req.headers);

      // Verify the token
      const payload = await verifyJwt(token);

      // Add user info to request
      req.user = {
        id: payload.sub,
        scopes: payload.scope?.split(' ') || [],
      };

      // Verify required scopes
      if (!hasScopes(req.user.scopes, requiredScopes)) {
        throw new Error('Insufficient permissions');
      }

      next();
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
    }
  };
};

module.exports = {
  requireAuth,
  hasScopes,
};
```

As you can see, in this middleware, we verify whether the frontend request contains a valid access token and check if the access token's audience matches the API resource we created in the Logto Console.

The reason for verifying the API resource is that our API resource actually represents the resources of our CMS backend, and all our CMS permissions are associated with this API resource.

Since this API resource represents the CMS resources in Logto, in our frontend code, we include the corresponding Access token when making API requests to the backend:

```typescript
// frontend/src/hooks/use-api.ts
export const useApi = () => {
  const { getAccessToken } = useLogto();

  return useMemo(
    () =>
      async (endpoint: string, options: RequestInit = {}) => {
        try {
          // Get the access token for the API resource
          const token = await getAccessToken(API_RESOURCE);

          if (!token) {
            throw new ApiRequestError('Failed to get access token');
          }

          const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}${endpoint}`, {
            ...options,
            headers: {
              'Content-Type': 'application/json',
              // Add the access token to the request headers
              Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
              ...options.headers,
            },
          });

          // ... handle response

          return await response.json();
        } catch (error) {
          // ... error handling
        }
      },
    [getAccessToken]
  );
};
```

Now we can use the `requireAuth` middleware to protect our API endpoints.

### Protecting API endpoints \{#protecting-api-endpoints}

For APIs that should only be accessible to users with specific permissions, we can add restrictions directly in the middleware. For example, the article creation API should only be accessible to users with the `create:articles` permission:

```javascript
// backend/src/routes/articles.js

const { requireAuth } = require('../middleware/auth');

router.post('/articles', requireAuth(['create:articles']), async (req, res) => {
  // ...
});
```

For APIs that need to check both permissions and resource ownership, we can use the `hasScopes` function. For example, in the article listing API, users with the `list:articles` permission can access all articles, while authors can access their own created articles:

```javascript
// backend/src/routes/articles.js

const { requireAuth, hasScopes } = require('../middleware/auth');

router.get('/articles', requireAuth(), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // If user has list:articles scope, return all articles
    if (hasScopes(req.user.scopes, ['list:articles'])) {
      const articles = await articleDB.list();
      return res.json(articles);
    }

    // Otherwise, return only user's articles
    const articles = await articleDB.listByOwner(req.user.id);
    res.json(articles);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch articles' });
  }
});
```

At this point, we have completed the RBAC implementation. You can checkout [the complete source code](https://github.com/logto-io/rbac-sample) to see the full implementation.

## Test the CMS RBAC implementation \{#test-the-cms-rbac-implementation}

Now, let's test our CMS RBAC implementation using the three users we just created.

:::note
If you find that you cannot sign in with the credentials of users created in "User Management", you'll need to enable the appropriate sign-in method first. Go to "Sign-in Experience" in the Logto Console and enable your preferred authentication method (such as Email + Password or Username + Password).
:::

First, let's sign in as Alex and Charles respectively and create some articles.

Since Alex has the Admin role, they can create, delete, update, publish, and view all articles.

![CMS dashboard - Alex](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/cms_dashboard_alex_a11863a94b.png)

Charles, having the Author role, can only create their own articles and can only view, update, and delete articles they own.

![CMS dashboard - Charles - Article list](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/cms_dashboard_charles_05f610066a.png)

Bob, with the Publisher role, can view and publish all articles but cannot create, update, or delete them.
