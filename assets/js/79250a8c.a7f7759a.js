Logto Cloud is built on top of Logto OSS, providing a seamless upgrade path without incurring heavy overhead.\\n\\nPlease note that this version is still in preivew, and as we continue developing the production version, some of the features and details showcased here may be subject to change.\\n\\n**TL;DR**\\n\\n- Logto Cloud (Preview) is currently available for free. The preview stage will end in summer 2023.\\n- We are in the process of finalizing our pricing plans, which will offer discounts based on your user engagement levels.\\n  - Typically, the monthly cost will be under $100 for 10,000 users and under $1,000 for 100,000 users.\\n- Our team treats Logto Cloud (Preview) as a production environment, ensuring a reliable and robust experience.\\n- All of your data, except for Audit logs, will be retained.\\n\\n## Terms\\n\\n**Logto OSS** is the open-source distribution of Logto, the source code can be found on GitHub.\\n\\n**Logto Cloud** is the official managed service from Logto team. It uses Logto OSS as the foundation, with some built-in connector and resource operations, which enable an operation-free experience when using Logto.\\n\\n**Logto Cloud (Preview)** indicates a free preview version of Logto Cloud with certain resource limitations.\\n\\nFunctionally, there are not much differences between Logto Cloud (Preview) and OSS.\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\nLogto Cloud is free during the preview stage, but it comes with certain limitations:\\n\\n- Each account should have only one tenant, and there is no team collaboration.\\n- Audit logs will be cleaned up every three days.\\n- The built-in Logto email and SMS connector both have a maximum of 100 sending quotas.\\n  - If you want more or you want to unlock this feature once Logto Cloud goes into production, please send an email to [contact@logto.io](mailto:contact@logto.io).\\n\\nThese limitations may not apply to the production version of Logto Cloud.
